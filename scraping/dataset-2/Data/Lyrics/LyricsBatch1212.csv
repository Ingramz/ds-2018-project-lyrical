Tommy Torres,"Falta muy poco para que regreses 
El reloj está en mi contra 
Las horas parecen meses 
Y aunque me digan que me aferro a lo imposible 
Ellos no saben (no, no, no) lo rico que se siente 

Cuando mi cuerpo se acerca a unos metros del tuyo 
La gravedad del momento es tan fuerte 
Que no dudo que tarde o temprano 
Te derrumbas sobre mí 

No es que yo crea que seamos tan distintos 
Pero tu instinto juega con los míos 
Y es que tarde o temprano, nena 
Ha de cambiar mi suerte 
Harás tu entrada como solo tú puedes 

Y nos rendiremos en brazos de nuestro destino 
Cada beso será tan urgente 
Y es que sabes que tarde o temprano 
Te derrumbas sobre mí 

Pasan los días y luego las semanas 
Y ahora te veo pasar 
Con el tipo ese 
Que va tan seguro porque no sabe 

Que cuando tus ojos encuentran mi fija mirada 
Tu me dejas saber que todo es pura fachada 
Que lo usas a él para jugar con mi mente
Ya no queda más que ser paciente 
Porque es claro que tarde o temprano 
Te derrumbas sobre mí 

Tarde o temprano 
Tarde o temprano 
Te derrumbas sobre mí 
Tarde o temprano 
Aterrizas sobre mí",Tarde o Temprano,2008
Tommy Torres,"Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres 
Prenden cuatro velas y se las ponen por los rincones 
Compran de esos iibros que les llaman de colecciones 
Van a la cocina y allí les prestan sus oraciones 

Que será, que será lo que tienen unas pero no otras 
Que un día te levantas y se te meten por dentro corriendo por toa' 
las venas 
No sé desde cuando pero ella me va buscando, me va encontrando y me 
va gustando
Es que me tiene mareao', divagando, borracho

Dime que me has hecho vida mía 
Porque ésto a mi me huele a brujería 

Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres

Dile 
Viento va, Viento va

Algunas lo dan todo otras no dan nada
Unas se quitan la ropa y otras no le hace falta 
Lo cierto es que cuando dicen que un hombre es suyo 
El hombre es suyo 
Y aun mas cierto es que estoy aquí buscándola, deseándola, pidiéndola 
Inventandola en mis lamentos 
Que será lo que me has hecho nena

Dime que me has hecho vida mía 
Dime qué, dime qué
Porque ésto más que amor ya es brujería 
Porqué tu me haces esto mija, porqué? 

Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres

Te tienen que haber dao' agua 'e fregao' mi socio 
No era destila', era de pozo
Que como fué? No te rompa el coco 
Los trabajos malos con fé los destrozo 
Sus porquerías se las revocamos 
Si hay que perdonar perdonamos, que carajo 
Papá creo un día despues del otro 
Pa' gente como nosotros 
Bota el golpe sin ponerse torpe 
En este mundo de cemento hay monte 
de sobra. Verde esperanza y por lejos que esté se alcanza 
Los ciegos sin anteojos ven todo 
lo que no sirve le dan de codo 
El amor es como lotería 
Gana el que tiene suerte no el que merecía 

Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres 
Prenden cuatro velas y se las ponen por los rincones 
Prenden cuatro velas y se ponen a
Compran de esos libros que les llaman de colecciones 
Compran libros de trucos, de cosas, de legiones 
Van a la cocina y allí les prestan sus oraciones 
¿Que fué? 

Ay, mujeres quieren a los hombres 
Hay mujeres y hay mujeres! 
Prenden cuatro velas 
Hay que tener cuidado con lo que comes 
Hechizos te ponen
Cuando las mujeres 
Que prendan velas por montones 
que yo tengo el que me proteje 
que me quiere, me cuida 
Cuando las mujeres 
prenden cuatro velas y te las ponen por los rincones
Ten cuidao' con lo que comes Tommy",El Trabajito,2008
Tommy Torres,"why no me has dado tiempo de disimularte que te quiero amar, que por un beso puedo conquistar el cielo why dejar mi vida atrás.
Quiero pertenecerte, ser algo en tu vida, que me puedas amar, con un abrazo fuerte, hacerte una poesía, renunciar a lo demás. Que cada paso oculta de lo que tu digas, en un beso hablara, ya no me queda duda solo ven why escucha, decidamos comenzar.

*CORO*
*Por besarte, mi vida cambiaria en un segundo, tu serias mi equilibrio mi destino. Bésame, solo así podré tenerte eternamente en mi mente.*

Un solo intento basta en este momento para poder saber si aun nos queda tiempo para estar en medio de lo que va a suceder. Conmigo no hay peligro, ven te necesito, la distancia no es motivo del olvido, aquí estoy yo contigo why para siempre yo estaré.

*CORO*
*Por besarte, mi vida cambiaria en un segundo, tu serias mi equilibrio mi destino. Bésame, solo así podré tenerte eternamente en mi mente.* ( x3)

Tommy Torres,"Diez y diez
Viernes en la noche
El final
De otra cruel semana
Todos ya tienen un plan
Pero hoy no estoy pa' bailar

Diez y treinta
Desplomados ya en la cama
Los amigos nos acusan de aburridos
Nos falta la urgencia de ayer

Quizás

Pero algo me dice
Que en las noches tan lentas
La luna se crece
Y la magia comienza
Se por experiencia que la cosa calienta
Como a las once y once ya veras

Diez y cuarenta
Te beso en el cuello
Y desde ahí, comienzan los sucesos
Tu cuerpo no ha dado señal
Pero, no ve voy a desanimar

Las y cincuenta
Una mordida en la oreja
Da resultado, pues te pone en alerta
No me quiero apresurar
Que va

Pero cuando te noto la piel erizada
Se que ya vas rumbo a morder la almohada
Miro el reloj y no se como pasa
Pero a las once y once quieres mas
No se si es de buen gusto continuar
Pero nunca me he sabido censurar

Y entre tirones de pelo
Y arañadas de espaldas
Los vecinos oyeron mas de lo que soñaban
El final mas perfecto
Para esta dura semana
Te veías tan hermosa ahí toda despeinada

Diez a.m
Despierto aquí a tu lado
Que suerte tengo
De despertar aquí a tu lado",11:11,2012
Tommy Torres,"Amelia
Se me hace tan hermoso pronunciarte
Pero para ir mas allá me falta arte.

Voy de nuevo
Sentado frente a ti aquí voy de nuevo
Con tanta inspiración y yo sin verbo.

Y es que no hay forma
De rayar tu perfección y prefiero
El silencio.

Amelia
Página tras página he botado
Llenas de metáforas borradas.

Amelia
Te podría dedicar tanta poesía
Mil estrofas llenas de cursiterías.

No creo
Que alguna ha de alcanzar tu grandeza
Dime entonces.

Para qué
Dañaras lo que es
Tan perfecto así
Con palabras tan gastadas
Mejor tu

Oh
Oh

Cuantas veces ya canté tu nombre
Cada vez me suena tan distinto

Tommy Torres,"Bailamos en un barco que se hunde. 
El paso de un ultimo bolero. 
En este mismo lugar donde hace algunos meses hubo risas. 
Tantas caricias. 

Pero hoy bailamos en un barco que ya no da más. 
Sabemos que no veremos la mañana. 
Por mas que intentamos mantenerlo a flote 
De cubo, en cubo. 
No se pudo. 

El agua nos llega a la cintura ya. 
Quedarse un minuto más ya sería locura. 
Los pies congelados, el pecho apretado contra el tuyo, 
es tan duro. 

Después de haber sobrevivido mil tormentas 
e inaugurar con la mejor de las champañas. 
La ilusión tuvo prisa. 
No firmamos salvavidas. 
Eso es para otros, no nosotros, no. 

Y ahora el agua nos llega hasta los hombros. 
Y flotando están todos los escombros de nuestro amor. 
En contra de todo, seguimos bailando. 
Seguimos bailando. 

Bailando. 
Bailando. 

No hay palabras que no estén dichas. 
Dijimos todo, dijimos demasiado. 
No hay inocentes entre nosotros. 
No hubo marineros solo demasiados capitanes. 

Tu no sueltas y yo tampoco. 
Y quién diría. 
Esto es de locos. 

Y ahora el agua nos llega hasta el cuello ya. 
El sabor tan salado no es del mar, 
si no de lágrimas. 

Los pies congelados, el pecho apretado contra el tuyo. 
Es tan absurdo. 
Pero hoy bailamos en un barco que se hunde. 

Se hunde.",El Barco Que Se Hunde,2012
Tommy Torres,"Mauro se levantó aquel martes
Con cara de punto y aparte.
Ya estuvo bueno, está decidido
Pues yo no nací pa’ sufrido.

Al escuchar a un gurú muy sabio de algunas 96 vidas.
Y sin pensarlo 20 horas mas tarde,
Mauro aterrizó en la India.

Y subió, la montaña mas alta subió.
Y cuando el viejo en la cara le dio,
Lo interrumpió antes de que hablara

Le dijo

Para que apeste, la azúcar.
Para el pan, la mantequilla.
Para crecer es la vida.

Para amarrarte, la culpa.
Pa’ protegerte está el miedo.
Y pa’ equivocarte, hazle caso.

Para el ateo está su mente.
Para el cristiano, la cruz.
Pa’ los budistas la flor de loto.

Pero en todos mis años, hijo
Yo nunca he encontrando paz pa’ un corazón roto.

Me entra a un oído y afuera el otro,
Se esfumaron las sabias palabras.

Que sabe un monje al fin y al cabo
De un mal de amores como el de Mauro.

Muy convencido llamó a un amigo,
De todos el más callejero.
Seguramente una noche de aquellas
Sería la mejor receta.

Y bebió, todo lo que al frente encontró.
Y en pleno entusiasmo de alcohol,
A ese amigazo le entró lo de poeta.
Y le dijo

Pa’ enamorarse está París.
Para olvidarse, Las Vegas.
Pa’ arrepentirse, el vaticano.

Para abrigarse, el invierno.
Para soñar, el otoño.
Y para encuerarse, el verano.

Pa’ recordar, el matrimonio.
Pa’ enloquecer, el divorcio.
Y pa’ rebajar, la venganza.

Pero créeme mi socio.
No se puede hacer negocio,
Con un corazón roto.

Hay que llorar, mil lágrimas hay que llorar.
Sólo tenemos la opción de escoger,
Si es ahora o después.

Va a doler, mil noches te va a doler.
No hay amnistía.
Ni gimnasia intelectual
Que te pueda liberar.

Dímelo Mauro

He hablado con sabios tan sabios
Que con sólo una palabra dicen 50 oraciones.
He estudiado muchos libros.
He destapado mil botellas
Buscando llegar al fondo.

He consultado al espejo.
He escuchado a mil pendejos
Con cara de inteligentes.

Para concluir que no hay remedio
Ni cercano ni remoto, para un corazón roto.

Que alguien me diga que se hace pa’ un corazón roto.

Dime

Que alguien me diga que se hace pa’ un corazón roto.

Dígame si algún jarabe pa’ un corazón roto.
Dígame si hay un jarabe pa’ un corazón roto.

Una de esas pastillitas pa’ un corazón roto.
Dígame si hay un despojo pa’ un corazón roto.

Dígame dígame dígame oh dígame.",Corazón Roto,2012
Tommy Torres,"Hoy me despierto tipo 10
Me quedo retozando un rato más.
Hago el brunch en un rico restauran.
La verdad, mi vida es ideal.

Y aunque no siempre ha sido así
Hoy tengo tanto y más, te tengo a ti.
No me da orgullo confesar
Que ahora sí, yo quiero más.

Más de la inocencia del ayer,
La ilusión de la primera vez.
Más hasta que no se pueda más,
Como niño en Disneyland.
Si no es mucho pedir, yo quiero más.

Yo soy de una generación
Que vive todo en exageración.
Hay que guiar el más monstruoso camión.
Hay que tener la más nueva gigantesca televisión
Que se ve a de Plutón.

Y aunque no siempre ha sido así,
Me ha tomado un tiempo describir
Que en la sencillez soy más feliz.
Y aún así, yo quiero más.

Más de la inocencia del ayer,
La emoción de la primera vez.
Más de aquella insoportable paz
Que tuve alguna vez.

Ayer vi en la televisión
Un monje que encontró la solución.
Decía que su única posesión
Era esa túnica puesta y su cara de satisfacción.
Y aunque no creo que llegue hasta ahí,
Me hace mucho bien el concluir
Que hoy yo más que pedir, yo quiero dar
Al decir que yo quiero más.

Más de la inocencia del ayer,
La emoción de la primera vez.
Ahora, si se trata de pedir,
Permiteme añadir
Agua para que mis nietos no pasen sed.
Aire limpio pa’ verlo crecer.
Más hasta que no se pueda más,
Como niño en Disneyland.
Si no es mucho pedir, yo quiero más.",Disneyland,2012
Tommy Torres,"Con mi copa en alto me levanto
Me toca dar un brindis en tiempos difíciles
Quisiera entrar con algo que inspire esperanza
O esa la trillada frases de “unidos venceremos”

A ver
Que les digo
Yo no soy adivino
Cualquier pronostico seria errático
Vienen tiempos buenos
No lo dudo
Pero que hacemos, mientras tanto

Solo hace fácil mirar alrededor
Ver tantas caras llenas de incertidumbre
Los mas viejos se les ve tan tranquilos
Por que saben que todo es tan relativo

Dicen
Vivir con miedo
No es negocio
Solo para los noticieros
Lo que digo, es si el futuro es negro o blanco
Que vivamos
Mientras tanto

Mientras tanto vivamos mientas tanto
Corramos en la lluvia, pies descalzos
Brincando de charco en charco

Mientras tanto busquemos a esa chica
La que nos tiene delirando
Robemosle un primer beso o unos cuantos

Mientras tanto

Vivimos con el miedo del ultimo día
Desde que murió el ultimo dinosaurio
Se acercan grandes cambios según los optimistas
Mejor no dar un paso por si acaso

El pasado es cuento
Y el futuro no ha llegado
Se nos va la vida esperando
Todo el mundo apuesta a que algún día saldremos de esta
Y ami lo que me interesa es el mientras tanto

Mientras tanto
Gocemos mientras tanto
Gastemos los pulmones en la ducha
Cantando desafinados
Mientras tanto y por que no mi amiga
Agarra algún extraño
Regalale un primer beso, o unos cuantos

Fuiste tu disfrazado de ti quien pario a tus enemigos
Fue Dios disfrazado de ti quien curo todo el castigo
Mientras tanto a improvisar
Y como dijo una canción sigo aquí
Que yo sigo aquí oh…

Mientras tanto
Amigo mientras tanto
Contemos las historias que de niños nos contaban los abuelos
Para que esto mejore mis señores
Las mejores intenciones
Pero en lo que esto se endereza
Mientras tanto vamonos pal campo
Tirémonos de nalgas cuesta abajo
Cojamos terapia en el fango

Mientras tanto busquemos a esa chica
Que nos tiene tan enamorados
Robemosle el primer beso o unos cuantos
Mañana pues ya veremos
Por hoy no nos congelemos
Mientras tanto
Mientras tanto",Mientras Tanto,2012
Tommy Torres,"Querido Tommy, te escribo esta carta
No se si tu realmente lees estas cartas
Te escribo para pedirte algo
Que para mi es de vida o muerte
No pienses que exagero es la verdad

Mi nombre es Paco y te escribo de Santiago
Hay una chica que no se sale de mi mente
Para eso eres tan elocuente
Y a ella le encanta tus canciones
Te imaginas ya por donde voy

Es que con ella no me salen las palabras, y quizás
Tu pudieras ayudarme, a decirle que yo muero aquí por ella
Y de una forma un poco mas poética
Que eso del romanticismo a mi no se me da
Dame algo tan bonito que le saque mil suspiros
Decirle que la amo y nada mas

No se si bastara
(Noo ohh)

Señor Tommy: aquí le escribo nuevamente
No me ha contestado, pensaba que era buena gente

Puede que este muy ocupado
Pero yo estoy desesperado
Ayúdeme a encontrar la forma
De decirle que yo muero aquí por ella
Pero de una forma un poco mas poética
Que eso del romanticismo a mi no se me da

Deme algo tan bonito, algo que nunca le hayan dicho
Decirle que la amo y nada mas

No se si bastara

Amigo Paco: disculpe la demora
Espero no te moleste
Que haya copiado aquí tu historia
En el amor no soy experto
No se de donde sacaste eso
Y nada puede estar mas lejos de la verdad

No confundas palabrerías con sentimientos
Las metáforas son solo pajas del intelecto
Si me preguntas que decirle a tu chica

Solo dile que te mueres por ella
No se me ocurre una mejor manera
Que eso del romanticismo
Es solo un juego de ajedrez
Cuando se trata de sentimientos
No hay nada como ser directos

Dile que la amas y nada mas
Seguro bastara",Querido Tommy,2012
Tommy Torres,"El amor es un río
Que va en una sola dirección.
Y no se detiene,
No busca el camino corto.

Mas si la lluvia no ha caído,
Aguanta algunos meses.
Pero llega el año y se seca.

Mi amor era un río,
Que dio más de lo que recibió.
Eras mi reina
Y yo era tan solo tu bufón.

Te divertiste por un tiempo.
Yo vivía del intento.
Pero el cómico disfraz
No me queda ya.

La estrategia de ser paciente no te fue suficiente.
Tomó tanto tiempo dame cuenta.
Mas hoy otra sabe valorar lo que tu no supiste.
No es resentimiento, pero tú te lo perdiste.

Mi amor es un río
Que al fin encontró el océano.
Ella me ha dado
Todo lo que contigo me faltó.

No te diría nada de esto.
Pero es que hace algunos meses
Es que me has estado buscando insistente.

La estrategia de ser paciente no fue muy inteligente.
No recomiendo que sigas esa ruta.
Pues hoy otra me ha robado el alma
Y lo rico que se siente.

Y no es por ser muy obvio,
Pero tú te lo perdiste.

Pero es amargo que deseo
Ven y déjame en los labios
Un trozo de tu cielo

Estar contigo ha sido dulce
Pero es del dulce que envenena
Aún así, mézclate en el aire
Y corre por mis venas

Es que ha llegado ya la hora
De parar este sinsentido
Que por más villas de vuelo
Siempre regreso al mismo nido

Y es que sin ti
Lo dulce sabe amargo
Y es que sin ti
Me quedo en la mitad

Me es algo indiferente
Sin ti no sabe a nada, no no

Estar contigo es complicado (ven y acércame esos labios)
Si me preguntas no sé que hago aún a tu lado
Sin ti todo hace más sentido
Pero es tan aburrido

Contigo todo es inestable
Pero la adrenalina es insuperable
Así que déjate de cuentos
Y haz lo que tu sabes

Es que ha llegado ya la hora
De darle tregua a esta batalla
Aunque razones hay de sobra
Nadie ha tirado la toalla

Y es que sin ti
Todo lo dulce sabe amargo
Y es que sin ti
Siempre me quedo en la mitad
Si es de día o de noche

Yo no sé
Mucho de la vida yo no sé.
Pensaba que a este punto yo tendría
Todas las respuestas, pero ves
Que yo no sé
Si voy con la corriente o al revés.
Y cuando yo pregunto me repiten
Que rece un padre nuestro y tenga fe.

Las horas dan y dan en el reloj.
El mundo cada vez lo veo peor.
Me quiero levantar y pienso
Bye oh bye, para qué?.

Si yo no sé
El que existe ahí fuera par a mí,
Que sea más rico que quedarme aquí
Yo, debajo de estas sabanas junto a ti.
Ay yo no sé.

Papa pa parara

Y yo sé
Que no debo tener miedo a lo que aún no es
Pero quedarme en el momento, a mí me cuesta.
Me piden que de un paso y yo doy diez.
Y sé también
Que este sentimiento pasará
Y que un día de estos se caerá el hechizo,
Seremos como niños otra vez.

Los días van y van como reloj
Y afuera el mundo gira en descontrol.
Me asomo a la ventana y pienso
Bye oh bye, levantarme, para qué?.

Las horas dan y dan en el reloj
Y mi universo está en este colchón.
Te veo ahí tan coqueta y pienso
Bye oh bye, dejar esto, para qué?.

O al revés si quieres yo y tú 
Yo tu novio y tú mi novia 

Tú y yo, qué frase tan genial 
Es algo tan elemental 
Cuando sale de tu boca 
Comerte a besos me provoca 
Ay, soy inmortal 

Tú y yo, yo y tú, qué hermosura 
Tú y yo o al revés es la locura 
De cualquier manera que lo pongas 
Yo seré tu novio y tú mi novia 

Para siempre solos tú y yo 
O al revés solo yo y tú
Yo tu novio y tú mi novia 

Esta es la historia que muchos quieren pero que otros la odian 
Cuánta gente no quisieron que fuera mi novia 
No nos creyeron y vieron cómo crecieron 
Los sentimientos y vernos juntos, eso los agobia 

No soy experto en estas cosas 
Pero sé que el amor no es un libro 
De pintar que coloreas de rosas 
Hoy somos novios, mañana tal vez seas mi esposa 
Y aguanto las espinas y me quedo con mi rosa 
(Tú, y yo nada más baby) 

Tú y yo, yo y tú, qué hermosura 
Tú y yo o al revés es la locura 
De cualquier manera que lo pongas 
Júrame que siempre nuestra historia 
Yo seré tu novio y tú mi novia 

Para siempre solos tú y yo 
O al reves solo yo y tú

Tommy Torres,"Ella se desliza y me atropella 
Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Sé que el día que la pierda volveré a sufrir 
Por ella, que aparece y que se esconde
Que se marcha y que se queda
Que es pregunta y es respuesta 
Que es mi oscuridad, estrella

Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda 
Va conmigo pero no sé dónde va 
Mi rival, mi compañera, que está tan dentro de mi vida 
Y, a la vez, está tan fuera
Sé que volveré a perderme 
Y la encontraré de nuevo 
Pero con otro rostro y otro nombre diferente y otro cuerpo 
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva
Nunca me responde si al girar la rueda

Ella se hace fría y se hace eterna 
Un suspiro en la tormenta
A la que tantas veces le cambió la voz 
Gente que va y que viene y siempre es ella 
Que me miente y me lo niega
Que me olvida y me recuerda 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Y al llamarla nombro a otra 
A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea 
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar 
Que hay quien no tiene corazón 
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema, no no

Y, ¿ si fuera ella? 
No, no, oh no

A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

¿Era? ¿quién me dice si era ella? 
Y, si la vida es una rueda y va girando 
Y nadie sabe cuándo tiene que saltar y la miro 
Y, ¿si fuera ella? Y, ¿si fuera ella?","Y, ¿Si Fuera Ella?",2017
Tommy Torres,"Justo cuando yo me confié 
Y una vida entera imaginé 
Justo cuando yo cerré los ojos y salté 
Sin saber lo que venía después 

Justo cuando yo bajé la guardia 
Cuando vi una luz en nuestra historia 
Justo cuando quise añadirle el para siempre 
Tú te fuiste, así tan de repente 

Con mi amor atado entre tus manos 
Con mis sueños todos enredados 
Con mi amor tan lejos de tus labios, oh 
Justo cuando yo me enamoré 
Te fuiste y no sé por qué 

No sé si te habrá ganado el miedo 
O es que para ti fui solo un juego 
Todos mis amigos me decían 
Ten cuidado, mírate 
Estás muy entregado 
Oh! Mírame 
Cómo me has dejado

Con mi amor atado entre tus manos 
Con mis sueños todos enredados 
Con mi amor tan lejos de tus labios, oh 
Justo cuando yo me enamoré 
Te fuiste y no sé por qué 
No estás 
El alma se me va 

Y cuando tú me sueñes, volverá a su lugar 
Con mi amor, atado entre tus manos",Atado Entre Tus Manos,2018
Tommy Torres,"No sé como llegó tan lejos
Lo que comenzó como un juego
De fijar mis ojos en las curvas
De tus labios

Admiraba tu belleza
Y sin querer crucé al otro lado
De desearte aunque no debiera
Qué pecado

Y aunque traté de alejarme ya era tarde
Se me salió de las manos

Y ahora todo me recuerda a ti
Toda idea desemboca en ti
Y no hay verso que me salga
Que no rime con tu nombre

Y ahora paso todas las mañanas
No queriendo salir de la cama
Porque afuera y en la calle
Me fijo en los detalles tontos

Todo me recuerda a ti
Me recuerda a ti

Ahora ni en las noches duermo
Imaginando el calor de tu cuerpo
Y tus piernas suaves enredadas en las mías

Por más que yo intente pensar en otras cosas
Viene el deseo y me arropa

Y ahora todo me recuerda a ti
Toda idea desemboca en ti
Y no hay verso que me salga
Que no rime con tu nombre

Y ahora paso todas las mañanas
No queriendo salir de la cama
Porque afuera y en la calle
Me fijo en los detalles tontos

Todo me recuerda a ti
Me recuerda a ti

No hay nota que yo toque
Verso que yo escriba, no
Que no me haga pensar más en ti
No hay escape de esta dulce obsesión

Y ahora todo me recuerda a ti, todo
Me rima con tu nombre, tu nombre

Y ahora paso todas las mañanas
No queriendo salir de la cama
Porque afuera y en la calle
Hay miles de detalles tontos

To shake a leg

How the Charleston is done

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth

Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

In my favorite cabaret

And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

There is nothing for me but to love you,

Tearing my fear apart

It touches my foolish heart.

On a day for singing,
My heart went winging

And lonely for me

You said you could live without loving
In your loveless mansion on the hill

To give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you're living in sorrow

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,
Ton Van Bergeyk,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending

Tonasia,"I was alone when you came into my life 
I thought you were the one to open up my eyes 
But now I see you were just neglecting me 
How can you do this to me 
Cause I did not abuse your love 
You took my heart and you tore it apart 
And I tried to explain my love to you 
But it seems your love wasn't true 

[Chorus] 
Wondering if this love we had is true 
And I'm wondering was it me or you 
Wondering where did it go wrong 
And I'm wondering how it lasted so long 

There was a time when I thought that you were mine 
Just a touch, your love was in my mind 
You took my heart and you tore my soul apart 
Why'd you use me from the start 
You used to lie to me 
Cause you said the truth would hurt me 
And your thoughts were always wrong 
But my love for you was so strong 

[Chorus: x2]

Girl you know what I needed 
I needed some of that good lovin' 
Yeah baby, the one that only you can give me 
Only you, but now you're gone 
And this love affair of ours is over 

My friends tell me that her love was never true 
But I always thought it would be something new 
But she kept my love suspended like a puppet on a string 
But tell me babe, did you really love me 
You know what I needed 
I needed your love

Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
Old friend of mine she sleepin' with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times

And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishin' checks and royalties
She's thinkin' it's true love, he's scammin' her for the quop
? to devise my own intuitive plot

Put the pros on him, launched the probe on him
Now harm him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted

Guess who you're 'bout to murder tonight?
Miss pretty brown eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib, you'll find under the mat
In the front of the house, just do it, word out

Evil eyes that bide, how they go
You ? lied to me, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go

God, why is my wife bleedin'
Sheet covers her face, paramedics are leavin'
Her eyes are closed, it's apparent she's not breathin'
I'm a little confused about what it is I'm seein'

Plus, there's a naked man on my lawn
Police in the livin' room with all of they guns drawn
Out and the last thing I remember is
Uh, last thing I remember is

I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cell phone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a six pack of O'Douls and some soul food

Yeah, and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone
But fuck it, 'cause my wife isn't back from her trip
I sneak ? into the house
And she'll never expect it, except that

He put the gun in my hand
Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

I tied his hands behind his back to the night stand, fast
Ropes made bruises on his light skinned ass
See, I can play games too
Yeah, that's what I told him when he came to

Now look, see what the game and the fame do?
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck man, we grew up together
Run DMC, tougher than leather

With the same outfits, forty deuce
Takin' flicks like what, shit
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man

I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead, I saw red, he said
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everythin' you imagined? Was it perfect?

He put the gun in my hand
Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

He put the gun in my hand and told
Told me to go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away, no
It's only gon' bring more pain

Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have, to hold, to love and cherish but
Death did us apart, what a coincidence
Now, perhaps the police will be convinced

That it was an accident
If I'm accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker trespassin' up my residence
And to believe those vile set a precedence
From the start I should have been obvious, I never did

Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And this is the stick where you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art

And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
365 days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how would achieve the murder would vary
We're closer than ever, together we'll be buried 'cause

This is for them hustlers scufflin' for them ends
Tryin ta get a mill, (fancy cars) and a house on the hill

I dwells in the city, a bank is where ya bound to suffer
Lifestyle filled with hoodsters, players and hustlers
Busters want to shut me down, I suppose
'cause I'm makin cash flow as my ghetto life dispose
I gets my hustle on from dust to dawn, Perignon
(Damn, how my life transformed like Voltron!)
Chargin like Natron by any means
These collard greens is goin' quicker than the forests are evergreen
Now one-time tryin ta shut me down 'cause I'm on a 
Mission makin' ends in my Benz bendin corners

Fools be Coupe deVille yet still I stay real wit mine
If the ten reaches dome, so long! So catch me next time
So, wordly rhymes they been kind to me
Hoes lie to me, make me try to be what they not, see
I'm gonna call you Wimpy (Can I please bawl, word?)
A dollar a day and ya gladly pay me back tomorrow
Hell no! I feel no sorrow, I scuffle to get this mill
I've excelled, grab a grip, need no chip for this packed 10

Triple beam, thirty schemes and crack fiends
Got me to the point where I can make my 6-4 lean
Hard times got me bussin' cheques that ain't mine
I got good credit but like I said it ain't mine
I'm stressed out and I need paper therapy
I'm sick and tired of family and friends takin' care of me
I'm on a one-way ticket to lavish homes and cars
Do anything to make a mill and be a ghetto star

Well what'd make you laugh or make you cry?
Where things that come faster
Live it last and the weak'll surely die
Multiply life times death, what's left?
A big house on the hill and I can feel this best quest
As Uncle Sam ain't the man he supposed to be
We out here gettin' lynched while most niggas baggin' groceries
Most of these wannabe's get they meal ticket
Claimin' they from hoods
It's still too good but they don't still kick it

Livin' the lifestyles of the po' and lonely
Only takes my mind to mold to make a grip of money
Funny how time flies when you ain't broke
Gotta gets me a mill 'cause I feel I can't cope, though
I'm down and out in the S-see, less see
Gimme a biz and then get rid of Betsy
I know the whole world on first name basis
But still I get ignored by friends in high places
The chase is on, I gots ta get paid
I'm special like ed. so you can say I got it made

My flows got it buggin', don't mess with my Clicc man
Snap lyrics like a picture, make em say Dougie's a sick man
Hustle every day that's the way that I was brought up
Gotta make more chips than Ruffles, scuffle, sneaky plan thought up
Caught up wit Tone Def, not Fargo, or will I wells

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'

I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said You're a liar
I said I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire
Took her to the hotel she said You're the king

I said Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing
Wild thing 
Wild thing 
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy

I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said You have plans for the night
I said Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other

I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing
Wild thing

She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please
Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype

And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside

I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing
Wild thing

She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque

This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way

And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing
Say what

Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe

Fire from the flame from the depths of hell
When I grip the microphone I tend to rock well
Burning like the rays that shoot from the sun
The title taker back breaker, coolin to the maximum
I get respect with the dollars, that I collect
I'm livin large, in massive charge, in full effect
You say you're broke without knowin, who owes ya
I do shows from here to Nova Scotia

Demonstratin, as eyes, are vindicated
You are relatin but later you said you hate it
Like a cobra, I strike at any time
And then it's over, as soon as I bust a rhyme
You are silenced wonderin, ""What's going on? ""

Standin brave, the one true soldier

And I'm pricin hard like Tyson

A crowd rocker and I'm the one you chose
And I'm advisin you suckers don't get close

I'm ready to start (So am I) Well, OK
I've been held back for several years
I had a few squabbles, never shedded no tears
But like an uzi on the mic they call me Tone Capone
Slangin' down with your posse if you're standin' alone
Cultivatin' all cities and tearin' up towns
I treat you like a king goin' for a rebound
When I'm on the mic, some say that I'm treacherous
They used to be the best - yeah, I bet you was
I never lost a battle, I ain't never been beat
Go look on the sharp tombstones on the street
Suckas like you try to diss with nerve
But I slay you down and lay you down next to the curb
Now I'm all in flesh, blindin' the one that stare
I drop you on the pavement, leave you parked in the rear
I don't need no protection so here's a little lesson
When I leave the house, insured my Smif-N-Wessun
A .357, cold bobbin' off 11
It puts you in hell, or it could place you up in heaven
You lookin' for trouble, then it's trouble I spark

Oh yeah, (?) gets hard

I'll start mobbin' motherfuckers like a savage beast
I'm takin' my turn to make the mic burn
And when I'm teachin' class, there's a lesson to be learned
Now I battle posses and tribes alike
Never battle out of hate; I always battle for spite
Cold jealous of me, the Westside man
The leader of the brothers, and killer of the Klan
But I don't give a shit 'cause my rhyme is legit
Cold put you in the yard and tie you up with my pit
'Cause when she starts to bite, that's when I will ignite
The views of the party taken to new heights
I consider myself to be a part of the elite
Suave and debonaire because the rhyme is so sweet
Been causin' confusion, magician of illusion
You got a little, problem, here's a solution
A winner never quits and a quitter never wins
So why you just gamblin' with dubs and fiends?
Remember what I say, it sticks like Krazy Glue
I'm tellin' you now, I'm not afraid of you
Look up in my face, I'll tear your heart apart
And like I told you before, (what?) I get Loc'ed After Dark

I'll make you see why Stevie had to Wonder

The Chosen One, puttin' LA on the map
With no objection I plead my case
Tone Loc, full capacity, leavin' out of space
The ace contender will never surrender
When I rock a show you always remember
The one and only, superior to many
Me losin' a battle? Naw, I can't remember any
Although, in the days, I may have lost one
Who the hell am I kiddin', I ain't been outdone
'Cause I'm the best, and I live out West
And if you want a dope song, I'll play your request
It don't take much to make a crowd live
Just some Boots and some droids and a little bit of slide
I step on stage and clear my hair
My next start, hmm, just a knock-up dare
No Uzi, my voice from the start
But you never know (why?) 'cause I get Loc'ed After Dark

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Yo Wop, wussup, why don't you do me a little favor, man, why don't you 
Scratch my back for me? (dj scratches) Ohh yeah. Little bit over to the

And when I'm finished rockin you will appreciate it
The structure of this rhyme will reign supreme
To have a cut like this is a MC's dream
You first heard this cut, you thought it was imperceptible
Now you're groovin to it, that makes it acceptable
Party people, listen to my word
The note on the door said 'do not disturb'
While I create the jam to take you little bit higher
Don't get close, this cut is on fire

To turn the party out my rhymes are always suitable
Considered very healthy like a sauna, therapeutical
Owner of the mic, yeah, L-o-c
Never spent a day in college, got many degrees
Not fully educated but dedicated
Until this jam I was extremely underrated
Now I'm rockin parties from sea to sea
Talkin 'bout everything from a to z
Some say my style is lackadaisical
Now you hear the music and you say, ""That's the way to go""
A show, a gig, it has signs to picket
Now I'm rockin stronger and you want free tickets
You once-a-month rapper, you're weak and you've shown it
Don't waste my time, I need an opponent
Not only will I dog you but I make you retire
Don't get close, this cut is on fire

Last time you heard my voice you claimed it was obnoxious
Your foot started tappin, it was in your self-conscience
I know it's hard to believe a million sold
Every time I start bustin, you lose control
My verbal coalition is a little outrageous
Like a plague my rap is contagious
Causin much grief, no sympathy for pain
Hard beats and fresh lyrics is what I attain
You can take this brand new style of hip-hop
Cold put it at the bottom, it will reach the top
Because the rhyme is so def, you stand in amazement
Time's up, I got another engagement
Rhymes never empty, I keep them replenished
The crowd skeezer-teaser until they're finished
Smoke from the cut, you better put on your glasses
Guaranteed to knock you all on your asses
And ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
Like on the back of the dollar it says 'In God We Trust'
The smoke-filled room make the suckers perspire
Don't get close, this cut is on fire

You never seen a MC with such style and finesse
Wearin hella silk shirts and pants by Guess
You can search the universe, but you never will find
Another MC with a style like mine
Cause if you do, we'll battle to hell
And your head'll be cracked like the Liberty Bell
Like a sculpture and a statue I'm pittoresque

I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said You're a liar
I said I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire
Took her to the hotel she said You're the king
I said Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing
Wild thing (x2)
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said You have plans for the night
I said Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing
Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please
Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing
Wild thing
She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww yeah!

It was a few years back if I recall 
I was out on tour, miami, just havin a ball!
Had a few medinas one night, we decided to hit this club
Twelve deep, gotta freak, 'cause y'know I got major pub
Little did I know that I was in for a big surprise
Met this lil' sweet cutie thang wit' them beautiful golden thighs
+he+ said, ""tony, y'know I'm playful we can, huh, do the do""
I said, ""I'm goin' back to my plac' baby, the falcon ?bleu?""
We got off the elevator, to my suite on the nineteenth floor
But inside, my boy {?} was tearin' up this score
So me and this little drove down to the beach and sssoothed
I was diggin' up sand and that baby howlin' at the moon
I was all up in the mix and everything was copasetic
An officer came, shined his light, and said (""son, you can forget it!"")
I yelled for help, but the punk said, ""there's no one left to save ya""
Daymn! [damn] locked up for my um freaky behaaavior

I remember back when I was five-and-a-half
Hangin' out a my homie's lil' six-year old birthday bash
Me and my next-door neighbor, big willie, know him that well
I used to play with him anyway, 'cause his mom was fine as hell!
Y'know one of them brothaz, who's moms look real young 
And just ta get a glimpse, you used to go over and play wit' her son, yeah!
Well back to this party, it was boring and kinda slow
Playin' ""pin the tail on a donkey"", hey, and my turn to go
They blindfolded me, but I could see her so, yes
I pinned the tail smack-down, boom, kenny's mom chest
I couldn't help myself y'all, ha-as the lord is my savior
Whoo, I got the whoopin' of my life from my ya  my freaky behaaavior, whaaa

Since I'm from cali I do a lil' swimmin' 
This one particular time, I had a whole pool fulla women
One swam over ta me, and of course she was doin' her breaststroke
Very damn extremely trimmin', she looked very dope!
She said, ""let's go inside, tony! and make love for {?}""
I said, ""why we gotta go inside, baby? let's do it right here!""
She said, ""here? in front of all these people? no way, forget it!""
I swam away, she said, ""wait! okay, I'm wit it!""
She took off her bikini, so I know it was time to jam 
And I was on the water, knockin' boots like blackuaman [aquaman] can!
She start to drown, so of course I have to save her!

I do believe the year was 1966

and ever since that day was born
like a mother from a baby, he could never be torn
From the neighborhood that ?tardy? so much
I'da hustle and chill, and surviving the clutch...
and if you didn't know, I'm talkin' 'bout the best side
Where the tribe reside on that Westside
This ain't Bed-Stuy, but it's like ""Do or Die""
Contemplatin' suicide to ride by
homicides, and then it's ova... (ova, ova...)
No rabbits for the four-leaf clover
Everything is everything, just mind yo' buis-ness
and when I handle mine, I leave no witness
So when you're walkin', aim straight and keep goin'
The rhymes are ?gumblin'? and the tribe is still, flowin'
Fo'-deep in the G-ride... (G-ide, G-ride..)

III remember the dayys, as a tee-ager
Before the hypeness, of a sky-pager...
It was +Happy Days,+ now +Who's The Boss?+
Instead of The Shuffle, we was doin' El Lacoss
and it was easy to catch a girl solo
Bust out the gigolo, but showed the polo
Before you thought we was coooold freakin'
BIG grindin', dancin' cheek to cheek and
Steal a kiss and you know I'm all excited!
Until the point where I can't even hide it
and when you know, someone stepped on my shoe
and why they do that? And I done had too many blues
I tried, real hard, to stay cool and calm
He didn't say, ""Excuse me"" so I had to BOMB
Lookin' at his {?}, I was only upset!
So I get, betta watch the step... (watch the step...)

Thinkin' 'bout a wife, a lil' boy and a girl
You can do this when your pockets are fat, not skinny
and at this point of time, I ain't makin' a penny
Hard times of it, so I gotta get my slang on
Back on The Ave., where I used to get my bang on
Homies all around, still pullin' llicks
Ain't worry 'bout a thang from Officer Dick
Yo they get theirs, so I gotta get mine
Knowin' damn well the risks of doin' time
to run this city, was the master plan
Yo I breathed the Aves., the block, the streets like a diaphragm
Times have changed, but I still scrap for mine (MINE)
That's how I'm livin' on the Westside

I grab tha microphone and rock it cold hearted
Go behind tha curtains while my fanz they point
You know what Loc's doin', I'm blazin a joint
Cause it seems a lot of times, I'm at my best
After some methical or a bowl of sense.
I'm creatin', multiplyin', big time supplyin'
Enuff bud to keep tha whole party high on
I might get ill and roll an 8th in one hooter
Park my Benz or cold jet it on my scooter
Bail to tha coast, take a head of this Skunk
Twist up a big bomb of this serious dope
Smoke it down to tha dub or roach tip
So much damn resin it's startin' to drip
It ain't harmful like heroin, this stuff's cheap
That's why I'm glad that I got this

It seems about tha time you really feel tha need
To get high, get full, you know get blasted
Keep ya singin' tha high it really lasted
Rollin' around tryin' not to get stopped
By tha boyz tha pigs you know tha cops
Pull into one spot to see what they're all about
Suckers noddin' their head, tellin' you they're all out
You go back to tha crib, Pick up tha telephone
You try it so I guess they saw you got home
Cause I can buy it O.Z. or go buy dime
I get cash for her I can get it on time
It really makes no difference long as I get lit
Roll it in my Zig Zag take a big bone hit
Cause after tha bud, My rhymes start flowin'
Never gettin' short of uh uh, The always knowin'
I'm maxin', relaxin', but never taxin'
No need for you to keep on askin'
If tha It is tha It, If tha Shit is tha Shit
Cause when it comes to smokin' cheeba
You know my shit is legit
Your tha student, And I'm tha teacher
I'm not a minister, Reverent or Preacher
So excuse me while I call time
Cause I'm gonna take a few hitz
 in tha middle of this rhyme.....

One day I was coolin' with my homeboy seal, chill
Gettin' fucked up in his coupe de ville, still
I wasn't to high to know what I was doin'
Went to tha store and got some more brew in
Came back to tha car, Try'd to be a winner
Rolled up all my roaches, they bearly made a Pinna (Pin)
I wasn't upset I had more at tha house
I was savin' it for later, When I get with my spouse
Cause when we're together, blazin' tha cheeba
She does things to me that you wouldn't believe
I'm not talkin' freaky or nothin' obscene
But it's not far off if you know what I mean
She'll take me upstairs, lay me down on tha bed
Pull off tha Fila shorts n start givin' me hizead (head)
If I was boo I'd do tha same
She must love it, She ain't never complained
They'll be moanin', kickin' a lot of screamin'
I work it so hard she starts steamin'
You know how it is after a couple of wooers
She was subject and I am tha Ruler
She's my freak y'all, but she's no skeeza
One thing for sure, Tha girl's always got that.....

Two weeks ago when I was writin' this rhyme
I had some hydroponic, Boy that shit was fine
I had two joints, One for me and my homie
After half tha show, He didn't even know me
His eyes were tight, they turned red
He could bearly hold them up, They where heavy as lead
An hour went by, He said Loc I'm kinda hungry
I said oh shit! This brothers got tha munchies
Got off my couch, put my Gucci's on my feet
Went to tha Seven Eleven at tha top of tha street
I ordered everythin' edible off tha shelf
He thought it was sad, I ate it all myself
When we got back to tha car, Headed north then south
I needed a drink I had a cotton mouth
We had so much food didn't know where to start
At tha Hagan Daas or Kelloggs Pop Tarts
Big bags of chips, gallons of dips
It took me weeks to get tha taste of my lips
I ate so much miserable is how I felt
Almost busted out my pants had to loosen my belt
Kickin at the tube, wathin' none better than
You know tha king of late night, Yeah Dave Letterman
Not to hilarious jokes kinda plain
But everythin' is funny when your smokin' Mary Jane.....

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine

Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance

So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'

I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said You're a liar
I said I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire
Took her to the hotel she said You're the king

I said Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy

I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said You have plans for the night
I said Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other

I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing

Tone-Loc,"Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def, yo, what's up with L-o-see?
The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm - ok, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina

You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies
Ya know?

Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on _The Love Connection_
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina

Ya know what I'm sayin'
That Medina's a monster, why'all

Yo! This for all my motherfucking niggaz
On the West Coast, on the East Coast
In the mid-West, the Dirty South
Nigga, I don't care what you doing
Who you wit, or where you at, nigga
Go Crazy, nigga
Go motherfucking Crazy, nigga
Get motherfucking sick wit it!

[Chorus 2X: Tonebone]
Sometimes I might get a little Crazy
Dipped and sticking doors with one-eighty
Ever since the G's raised me
The streets couldn't fade me, go Crazy

[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, all why'all niggaz go Crazy
Leave the bitch-ass niggaz braindead in the daily
Too many ho's yelling, ""Christ Bearer, save me!""
Bitches can't swim 'cause the water too wavy
My nigga, get a little nuts
The Wu don't give two fucks, Clan like Klu Klux
Lace the Digi with the 'dro
Tai Bo, bust ya fo'-fo', let ya hair down, ho
Ya gotta get a little sick
Let niggaz try to play you like a step-child and click
Fuck the dumb shit, nigga, trip
Lose ya grip, pull a semi-automatic out the whip
Get psychotic, neurotic, they want it, they got it
Bang it to the boogie, hypnotic
Dip a stick and do a quick one-eighty
Like G's that raised me, a Long Beach baby
Taught me the difference of a bitch and a lady
The streets can't fade me when I'm liable to go Crazy

[Shoshot]
Crazy, like hitting a bank with a three-eighty
And maybe, flip and pistol-whip an old lady
That's shady, ya think that's shady?
Hell, not as shady as the bitch that had my first baby
And maybe, that's why I blow big dope on the daily
And maybe, I'll fuck ten more bitches and have ten more babies
And lately, I've been wanting to take shit back to the eighties
And maybe, I'll drive-by shooting at niggaz that hate me
See baby, you know my story and that's the way it still goes
Real crazy, I'm still rapping baby and I still hate ho's
Shoshot is sick wit it, gots nothing for ho's
but conversation and some dick wit it, can you dig it?
I'm a zipped down fool, and niggaz pause when I spit it
I might strip to my drawers, when I trip off the liquid
See maybe, I need to get fucked up 'til I hurl
'cause I'm Crazy like 2Pac screaming ""Fuck the world!""

[Chorus 2X]
[Christ Bearer]
Yeah, fuck that, go looney
Screaming ""Bitch, sue me"", off the wall like a young Paul Moonie
Break a rule, act a motherfucking fool
Roll a cutty on D's, solo at the carpool
Play Clyde Bearer's like a young Warren Beaty
Let Bonnie be ya lady so the bitch go Crazy

[Meko the Pharaoh]
While niggaz go Crazy I stay amazing
Doing what I do, straight blazing
Re-arranging, the time structure in the streets
Rotating planets like my people far out, you can't see
Believe it or not, a drop
NorthStar make ya heart stop
Too hot.. yeah, my shit stay live.. wit a vibe
that makes niggaz go Crazy when they get high (pass that)
Bitches button down ya button-fly
Niggaz bust ya fo'-five, get real live
'cause ya only live this life once
So bounce to this motherfucker like you own one (bounce)
Dip a stick and straight trip on a nigga
Take a sip and straight spit on a nigga
'cause the streets straight raised me
But they couldn't fade me (nigga), go Crazy

Tonedeff,"Ayo, I'm playing knick-knack patty knock a beat the fuck out
Rejecting cats faster than gay kids bounced from the cub scouts
Tossed from the front door of the clubhouse, like, ""What's up now?""
Scour the grout off they feet and making 'em walk the rough route
I'm sick of niggas wearing Sean-John, always puffed out
Hogging mics, acting retarded, just like Forrest Gump sounds
So, if these rappers want to bust rounds, I'll have a field day
I'm always in-zones when I touchdown, Compton to Bucktown
Pounding the scrubs, How in the fuck your stuff counts?
When Verbs is on witness protection, after hearing how I snuffed Nouns
Stalk a circus and hunt clowns... If you're smoking
Tonedeff causes Emphysema, and will ultimately turn your lungs brown
And that's my recommendation, I'm saving ya' from deterioration
By making replacements for inferior baseman
Players that never could play at the game they were placed in
Checking the roster for their names, just to discover that they were scraped in

Yo, I cross cultures like puzzles of words
All y'all nickel and dime MCs are better off smuggling herb
The minute I mutter a verb, I spark infernos
I should be locked up for fucking kids like I was Mary Kay Latourneau
You saying there were no... Witnesses
Quick... If this hypocrite fibs a bit
Kick his shit in and just get the whip and a hypnotist
I'll finish him with a little lyrical hit and then stick 'em and spit in his 
Liquor with gin in it till he's admitting it
Y'all whack rappers are just effeminate
If eating dick's la vida loca, y'all niggas is living it
So, Come on! No need to do the arithmetic
This kid is just sick, so, heads up, peep my single ridiculous
I inconspicuously wow brothers, without stutters, leave sounds smothered
You couldn't come to grips with cow udders
Like proud mothers, I brag with the best of 'em
Ask your man what score he got after Mr. Deff tested

If you're the champ, hand over the fucking title now
More rules than a Cider House
Pay me the proper respect... Just close your eyes and bow
Its show and tell ya better hide your style
I'm trying to separate the whack from the weak and I can't seem to divide the pile
Stop grinning or I'ma strike ya smile
Like lawyers strapped with time bombs, you'll never survive the trial
'Cause I'll defile ya name, card your ass and swipe ya file
Bitch, I'm the river of venomous flows that spiked the Nile
Despite denial, some rappers are never happy
Yelling and shit with no email address talking 'bout get at me
Dog, I'm serious, with hand-helds I'm shouting out, like Nextel
Don't need a copy of Microsoft Office to Excel
Word. I'm making these power points like Bill Gates
'Cause yo, if tone is recorded on chrome, its instantly the ill Tape
You know Domingo makes the real breaks

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003

Since I was born I heard about this place
Where there is always sunshine and everyday is a Sunday
There will be no more rain no more skies that are gray
Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day


Chorus 1
All my life I've heard about this beautiful place
Its somewhere beyond the galaxy and outer space
Where the streets are gold as glass and sheer with transparency
Where we shout and sing His praise throughout eternity


Verse 2
As I grew old, I wondered bout this place
Will I ever get there; how much longer will I have to wait?
Then I felt a sensation from my head down to my face
On a Tuesday afternoon I felt my body change
I've been raptured!


Chorus 2
All my life I dreamed about this beautiful place
And I can't believe my eyes I really see His face
Reunited with my loved ones walking hand in hand
And the Holy River intertwines with emerald sand


Chorus 3
""Oh, my God, the flowers sing!!!""
As pure white horses kneel down
For the King has made His entrance at the trumpets sound
As we sing His throne changes from blue to aqua-marine
And to shades of indigo unlike you've ever seen

Has music really come to this?
Can't believe what I just saw on the video
Kids watching 2 girls kiss

Now I ain't hatin? on nobody?s hustle
'cause I know that the root is greed
Labels keep on manufacturing
While they procreate immorality
Everybody don't wanna hear this mess now

People want some oxygen
People want to breathe
Whatever you feed them
That's what they're gonna eat

Now it?s time to get back to the music now
It?s a gift from God so be careful how you use it now
Get high off of creativity
Flaunt your craft not your sexuality

Artists in this industry
Have a responsibility
To make songs that inspire
Human morality

Will I ever see the light of day?
The hurt and the pain all the sorrow that I feel
Will it cease, is there peace, will it ever go away?

I need to know is this so don't leave me out in the cold
A place of rest for your soul, tell me I need to know
I thought that I would completely lose my mind
When I heard from a friend, you passed away

I was shocked, I was scared, I was truly unaware
That a wound made at noon ran so deep inside me

Just like my face to a fist, why did it have to end like this?
Maybe just one last kiss
Could you have made your last wish
Just like the winter snow nobody seems to know
When will it come or go, why does it hurt me so?

Then I heard a voice whisper softly in my ear
Telling me not to fear as the tears rolled down my face
This is what it said

That most likely means you ain’t doin’ nothin’
Want the anointing, gotta go through somethin’

But if God gave you a ministry a gift or a calling
Don’t give up on your dreams

I only need your loving arms
You know that I'm plumb mad about you
I couldn't live without you
I'm just wild about your charms

Why don't you love me to pieces, honey
Squeeze me 'til it ain't funny
Give me the kisses that I crave
You know that I'll never ever leave you
And I'll never ever grieve you
You know that I want to be your slave",Love Me to Pieces,1999

It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too

He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

To hold her hand and then it's ten to one

Should I even try
Will I just be hearing the same old lines
Baby
See it doesn't matter
What you say this time
Cause our whole relationship
Is built on one lie
You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me

How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of

Love shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night

Gotta hand it to ya
Ya had me there for a while
I was so in love with you
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
Boy, I got a wake up call
And it left the message
That you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to
Believe that she doesn't mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin' my darling
I just don't need

Love shoulda brought you,
Brought you,
Home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you
To me last night

Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you
To me last night
Oh baby why
Why do men think that love's just for the moment
Not over time
Please tell me why
Why should I think that
You're gonna be sincere
Are you deservin'
Don't blame me if
I just don't believe,
I just don't believe
That you'll allways be here

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
And he's got lots of toys
and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

That you're really sorry 
And ask to be in my life again

Should've thought about the consequences then

I didn't have the strength to live 
But I was just too young to die 
See I have had my heart broken before 
But never like this 
I admit it baby left me feeling scorned 
Now the love inside my heart is fading 
The trust of my man and my best friend betrayed

Or start love over 
Oh no lovemaking will there be here tonight 
Oh don't you sigh

I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you

Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya,
From that radio
It's just

Toni Braxton,"I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out, thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch my falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me

How could an angel break my heart?
Why didn't he catch may falling star?
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart?

Toni Braxton,"First thing early morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better way
You see the thing 'bout love
Is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain
There comes a time when we could all make a change

Just let go
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Let go, and let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go

Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody want two time losers
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
You see the thing of it
Is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time when we must go our own way

Just let go
And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Let go, and let it flow, let it flow, let it flow

How can this be there he goes
Talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive does he know

The affair okay
He's corrupt
What do I do  what do I say
I feel ashamed  embarrassed  fatigued

But I could

Why is it that the men are forgiven and the women
Aren't
I don't know maybe, maybe I should forgive him
Maybe I'm over-reacting what do you think...not!

Said we'll be together for always
He's such a liar
Then he calls out her name

They are haunting my life
And he doesn't even know that I know

I just remind myself

You put my heart through hell

Just for old times sake
Well I am not about to make that same mistake

You turn my world around

You took the ease off my mind 
And put it behind 
You were there for all my needs 
So baby--stay

I wished for you 
I have never been so happy 'bout a love so new 
You opened my heart to a brand new start 
My love's there wherever you are 
I won't let no one take you away 
You took the ease off my mind 
And put it behind 
You were there yes indeed for all my needs--

Or how it was supposed to end
Please, tell me that part again

Now tell me what's wrong
I never meant to hurt you, no, baby, oh
Was it the home, the car
Or, darling, all those things we thought we needed?

When you're holding me

So here it is, and he comes right in 
And I fix us drinks 
And I start to think 
About what I'm gonna do 
Will a brother be true 
As he sizes my body up and down 

Can he beat the odds 
Can he play it safe 
Will he make me hot 
Will he hit the spot that I love a lot 
Will he leave me hanging, lonely, desperately 

Will he go and tell all his friends 
That we did it and we did it again 
Had me weak between the sheets 
Will he say I was a real big freak 

Maybe I should slow it down 
Cool off my flow, relax 
And let him know that if this gets out 
No more, no glove, no love 
Oh no, or 

Should I give him some?

Should I say yes or no 
Should I just let it go 
Should I slow down my roll

Don't know what to do about it baby 

If I do will I regret it 
Maybe I should just forget it

Toni Braxton,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
And he's got lots of toys
and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song [*],2001

Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

I have snowflakes of love smiling down on me
Winter bliss when we kiss

Snowy day
Would you please take me away
Away with you
Hold me so closely
Like the moonlight lights the sky

In my dreams of soft winter breeze
Eases my mind, but when I wake
There's nothing but leaves
Still, I'm happy
I have snowflakes of love smiling down on me

Oh, how I imagine the day we met
And those tingles from those little butterflies
Reminiscing, I get so happy
I just break down and cry

Candlelight burning bright
Underneath a cool, starry night
You and me, endlessly, it's the greatest gift
That love could give to me

You woulda been talkin' to me 
Everyday 
Seven days a week 
Baby 
Baby 
You shoulda been givin' me 
A little more time 
But you were just much too busy 
Abusin' me and usin' me 
I woulda done about anything 
Ya wanted 
I was there for you 
I was crazy about you 
When I was sittin' thinkin' 
I was kinda special 
You were runnin' round 
Hittin' every other girl in town 
How could you love me 
When you knew you played me funny 
You knew that you were wrong 
Dead wrong to be 
Mistreating me 
How can we go on 

Seven whole days 
And not a word from you 
Seven whole nights 
I'm just about through 
I can't take it, won't take it 
Can't take it no more 
I had about enough of you 

I'd rather be on my own 
Yes on my own 

Deep in my heart 
You were number one to start 
But then you changed 
You threw my heart away 
Told your friends that 
You were runnin' thangs 
Why'd it have to be that way 
You're wrong 
Dead wrong 
Tell me how 
How can we go wrong 

Seven whole days 
And not a word from you 
Seven whole nights 
I'm just about through 
I can't take it, won't take it 
Can't take it no more

Toni Braxton,"Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now, the nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart, say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door and walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart

Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left, time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart, say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door and walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart, say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door and walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears I cried so many, many nights
Un-break my

Un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me

Is where could he be at this hour

And hop up in the whip

To all the places where you know he hangs out

Loving you is stupid
Because I know that you never really loved me
And you never gave me a sign so I could see

That you and me would never have possibilities
And I feel so stupid
After all the nights you left me lonely to die
And you never gave me a reason why
And now I sit all alone and I cry

Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
Am I stupid?
I should have known you were only playing a game
And you and me would never be the same

You made me feel like Iâ??m the one to blame
And I feel so stupid
After all those nights after nights that I tried
And all those conversations of lies
And I'm sitting her all alone and Iâ??m crying

Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
I'm crying
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh

Can't believe you never knew I felt
All this love and there ainâ??t no one else
Who could ever love me the way that you do
You're all I need but you treated me so wrong and I canâ??t believe it
How could you do me like you?
Cause I've been so stupid for you

But hold up, who's she
What was I thinking
All I know right now is that I hate you
For what you put me through
With all of my heart I hate that girl you're with too
I hate you and everything about you
I won't apologize, you need to recognize
With all of my heart I hate that I love you

v 2

What could I have done not to hurt you
And what could I have done to not push you away
Tell me what I've done and I won't do it again oh babe
Just tell me what I did to deserve this
And tell me why you gave someone else my kiss
And maybe I won't die if you're back in my life again

Chorus

You, its me
But hold up, who's she
What was I thinking (damn)
All I know right now is that I hate you
For what you put me through
With all of my heart I hate that girl you're with too
I hate you and everything about you
I won't apologize, you need to recognize
With all of my heart I hate that I love you

Bridge

I hate the fact that I think about you
I hate that I can't sleep without you
I just can't get over not making love to you
I never thought that we'd end up like this
And heaven knows that my heart just can't take . . .
Damn for sure . . .I know right now . . .

Chorus

All I know right now is that I hate you
For what you put me through
With all of my heart I hate that girl you're with too
I hate you and everything about you
I won't apologize, you need to recognize
With all of my heart I hate that I love you

The little look in your eyes 
That lets me know that everything will be okay
Tell me what has changed
I find it hard to hold on
To the butterflies that used to be inside
You don't hafta say a word
It's written all over your face, so before...

So before the night is through
I want some time with you
Here's what we're gonna do...

Let's take the long way home
So we can be alone
And talk about what's goin' on
Pull on over to the side
All we have is time
So tell me what's on your mind
Let's take the long way home
I can see that something's wrong
Boy, you gotta let me know
While there's no one else around 
We can work it out, yeah
Let's take the long way home

I know it's messed up but I'm hopin' 
That we can get it together
It might be hard to see
When we're havin' doubts
Tryin' to work it out
And though it seems easier to pull away
You see, I want you to know that I will stay right here
'Cause we deserve another try
So let's just enjoy the ride

So before the night is through
I want some time with you
Here's what we're gonna do...

Take a left right here on Heartbreak Avenue
(it's where I first met you, boy) 
You said you wanna take a spin
That's how it all began
So, we can get it back to lovin' again

So we can be alone
And talk about what's goin' on

I'm not gonna leave you 'lone

",Long Way Home,2005
Toni Braxton,"It only took a moment
A solitary glance
And I could hear the voice of rapture call
Iâ??ve loved you from a distance
Afraid to take a chance
And now it seems I canâ??t help but to fall
Imagine my surprise
To open up my eyes
And find that you were looking back

And suddenly
I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly
Iâ??m no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

I longed to awake besides you
And bathe in love's abyss
Washing all that comes before away
And in this frozen moment as I receive your kiss
There will not be words enough to say
I wanna make you melt, touch you like noone else
And do it all again a thousand times

And suddenly
I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly
Iâ??m no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

In your arms

I wanna make you melt, touch you like noone else
And do it all again a thousand times

I never had to check his story
And worry about him when he's gone
Cause even when he's not at home
He's right where he said he'd be
I Never go to bed frustrated
And I never ever ever have to fake it
Cause when he comes our love makin'
He always seems to please

What he's serving it tastes so good to me
Say mmm mm mm
He ain't perfect, but he does it for me
My man's tailor made for me
He comes in just my size
And every time I put him on
I swear he fits just right
Baby that's how its sposed to be
I'm right him and he's down for me
There ain't no other lady
Who'll be sexin' my baby but me
Baby that's how its sposed to be
He knows where every single spot is
And everyone hears that drop
When he want to get it off
No problem, he knows its all of me
He ain't about the games and front no
Staking on his name means something
Ain't gon let him go for nothing
We gon' make history
Say mmm mm mm
What he's serving it tastes so good to me
Say mm mmm mm
He ain't perfect, but he does it for me

Tell me boy, what's it really gonna be?
Spending time for a while
Oh, Daddy, come close, I'm straight, I'm feeling your style

I love the way you make me feel when you keep it real
When you're holding me, when you're spooning me
When you look sexy, when you're touching me
When you're bumping me gently

Sitting here, waiting in my Vicky's
In the mirror, imagining you're with me
Petit Cheri and I'm smelling real nice
And Jouet could chillin' on ice

Coming over at a half past ten
And I'm wondering if I'm really gonna let him in
Give in, give it up
Let it go or tell him no

Should I give him some?
Maybe
This is the night for fun
Maybe

Here it is and he comes right in
And I fix us drinks and I start to think
About what I'm gonna do, will a brother be true?
Will he size my body up and down?

Can he beat the odds?
Can he play it safe, will he make me hot?
Will he hit the spot that I love a lot?
Will he leave me hanging lonely, desperately?

Will he go and tell all his friends
That we did it and we did it again?
Had me weak between the sheets
Will he say I was a real big freak?

Maybe I should slow it down
Cool off my flow, relax
And let him know if this gets out
No more, no glove, no love, oh, no

Should I give him some?
Maybe
This is the night for fun
Maybe

Should I just give him some?
Maybe
This is the night for fun
Maybe

Maybe, pretty baby
Love me like a lady

Should I say yes or no?
Should I just let it go?
Should I slow down my role?
Let me think 'cuz I really don't know
Don't know what to do about it, baby

Should I say yes or no?
Should I say yes or no?
Should I say yes or no?

Should I give him some?

This is the night for fun

Should I just give him some?

Love is found way down in the trenches
And he's throwin' a fit and she's sittin' there crying

We tear it up
(Tear it up)
To patch it up
(Patch it up)
Break up to make up
The show goes 'round and 'round
And that's how we get down

We go back and forth
And anybody who's been through this should know
That what I'm saying's for real
Real lovers feel this way

We say things that we don't mean
And that's the way love work out sometime
He trippin', she trippin' and we both be trippin' mayne

And life teaches a lesson that love is still a blessin'
'When it's all said and done we're back at square one
And that's the way love work out sometime

What you know about screamin', yellin', cursin'
Pushin' and rumbling and arguing
Like it's 12 rounds, up inside the garden

I say where the hell you going
And you say, I'm getting up out of here
And I say you ain't going no where
Then I follow you down the stairs
Get in front of you and I scream

It's times like this I know you're still the one
And the truth is this is really love and ooh, yeah
When I feel like going off, I brush my shoulders off
And you know

We say things that we don't mean
That's the way love work out sometime
He trippin', she trippin and we both be trippin', mayne

And life teaches a lesson that love is still a blessin'
'Cause when it's all said and done we're back at square one
And that's the way love work out sometime

You won't believe it until you see it
How much you need somebody, need somebody
And you'll never know how far you'll go
When you love somebody, love somebody, ooh, ooh

And that you need somebody, need somebody
And you'll love somebody, love somebody

We say things that we don't mean

When you walked out the door 
And walked out of my life 
Un-cry these tears 
I cried so many nights 
Un-break my heart 
My heart 

Take back that sad word goodbye 
Bring back the joy to my life 
Don't leave me here with these tears 
Come and kiss this pain away 
I can't forget the day you left 
Time is so unkind 
And life is so cruel without you here beside me 

[Chorus]

Don't leave me in all this pain 
Don't leave me out in the rain 
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me 

Un-break my heart 
Say you'll love me again 
Undo this hurt you caused 
When you walked out the door 
And walked out of my life 
Un-cry these tears 
I cried so many nights 
Un-break my
Un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me 
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin' 
Without you I just can't go on 
Can't go on",Un-Break My Heart [Instrumental],2008

Toni Braxton,"I never thought the sun would shine my way
All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream, cause a dream's unstoppable

I could've gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close

Storms and Rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up cause I know

Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream,
cause a dream's unstoppable

Dream
That you can fly,
Dream
That you can climb
Dream
A mountain, all you gotta do is just
Dream
That you can win,
Dream
With Confidence
Dream
To the very end cause dreamers become champions
Dream
Until it's real,
Dream,
Don't let them kill your
Dream
The fight still is in you, all you gotta do is
Dream,
Just keep the faith,
Dream,
Don't ever break
Don't let it slip away cause all you gotta do

Funny now how I'm gone

Toni Braxton,"Worked late, but you don't wait up
My bones ache; I'm cleaning the place up
Sometimes I don't even know why I care

I sit down; I take off my make-up
I lay down, but you don't wake up
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there

I can't remember the last time you told me I'm beautiful
And I can't remember the last time that you said anything at all

[Chorus]
I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And I deserve your all
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
'Cause being just your woman is not enough

Now I hope that you don't wake up
When it's too late to make up
You'll be the one that's alone and that's so sad

Ooo, in time you'll find somebody
The truth is she'll never be me
That's when you're going to miss what we had

Oh, all I really needed to hear was ""you're beautiful""
And all I really needed to hear was anything at all

I'm not your friend who only needs you sometimes
If I'm your lady, you got to treat me like

And white lace over my gown
And why must I be a Barbie doll figure
Like on a cake, on a crown

Underneath? and her dreams

Es ist komisch ich spüre wie mein Herz rast
Ich mach die Nacht durch morgen früh zum Herzarzt
Aber geht nich 
In mein Kopf Tetris
Notarzt, ich will sehen was EKG spricht
Ich kann nicht fahren brauche Geld für Taxi 
Plus noch ein 10er Gebühren für die Praxis
Ach ich scheiß drauf
Mach ne Flasche Wein auf
Pump die Musik laut
Und sitz auf meiner Kleincoutch
Das ist Leben jeden Tag Panik
Ich hab Angst vorm Sterben und dabei hab ich gar nichts

Ich hab das ganz große Kopfkino in mir drin
Und ich frage mich wann endet dieser Film?
Es muss aufhören weil es immer wehtut
Doch das is mein Leben ich schreibe mein Drehbuch

Ich hab das ganz große Kopfkino in mir drin
Und ich frage mich wann endet dieser Film?
Das muss aufhören ich schwör weil es dropt mich
Weil dieser scheiß mich zerstört und mein Kopf fickt

Alter mein Kopfkino is schlimmer als ein Schockvideo
Und es dropt wieder desshalb sind wir oft zierlos 
Doch was macht das schon
Wir sind alles gewohnt
Harte Drogen, Arbeitslos und wieder mal vom Staat betrogen
Wie willst du jemand brechen der längst gebrochen ist
Sag wie willst du jemand retten wenn dein eigener Kopf dich fickt
Du immer Opfer bringst
Doch es hilft dir trotzdem nicht
Es macht dein Kopf verrückt weil es dir keine Hoffnung bringt
Die Seele ist am Arsch
Radikal, abnormal und das Leben deiner Wahl ist brutal, assozial 
Vaterstaat fuckt dich ab deshalb machst du alle platt
Trag die Narben wie ein Mann
Verrat es lass es die andern machen
Du musst nach vorne sehen, aufstehen, 
Weitergehen nach Freiheit streben, weiterleben
Es darf dich keiner scheitern sehen
Oder du gehst unter und bist verloren
Da brauchst du dich nicht wundern denn dafür wurdest du gebor'n

Ich hab das ganz große Kopfkino in mir drin
Und ich frage mich wann endet dieser Film?
Es muss aufhören weil es immer wehtut
Doch das is mein Leben ich schreibe mein Drehbuch

Ich hab das ganz große Kopfkino in mir drin
Und ich frage mich wann endet dieser Film?
Das muss aufhören ich schwör weil es dropt mich
Weil dieser scheiß mich zerstört und mein Kopf fickt",Kopfkino,2013

Toni Fisher,"West of the wall I'll wait for you
West of the wall our dreams can all come true
Though we're apart a little while
My heart will wait until we both can smile
That wall built of our sorrow
We know must have an end
Till then dream of tomorrow
When we meet again

[Chorus]
West of the wall where hearts are free
West of the wall your heart can come to me
And in my arms that hold you tight
You will forget the darkness of the night
The world knows about sadness and we are not alone
West of the wall that soon will fall and you'll come home

Wall built upon sorrow
One day you will end
Hearts true to each other
Will not break
They will not bend
In our hour of sadness
How clearly we can see
Tomorrow's gladness
Free, free, free, free

[Chorus]

Come home

Toni Fisher,"Now it begins, now that you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching that clock till you return
Lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins, day after day
This is my night, ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say
""Love will appear and this time to stay""

Oh, each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
This time the big hurt will end

Now it begins, now that you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
But if you go, come back again
I wonder when, oh when will it end?

Lá em cima do morro
Ou sambando no asfalto
Eu canto o samba-enredo
Um sambinha lento e um partido alto

Há muito tempo não ouço
O tal do samba sincopado
Só não dá pra cantar mesmo
É vendo o sol nascer quadrado

The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when they break though these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains

I'm living proof, it can last a long time, now the girls up
The street are innocent and sweet while their all in bed
They got their makeup and dreams of wonderland

Sprinkled inside their heads soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood hills never seem so strange
Their mothers pray it will last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled
I wanna wish you merry Christmas
Ho, ho, ho

Now the boys are all grown up
And there working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone

I've been raking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up
I pray to God, it don't last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I hear the sound of bells
There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow

Through the night on a great big sled

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Now I was clicking out my barrel just to see if it was loaded 

checking out it's bullets just to make sure it won't explode this 

hand around of the handle of my snub  no skill 

I must be for real in the procedure for a kill 

stood around the corner while I cased out the bank 

busted in the door and stuck the guard wit' a shank 

ran up to the counter pull the gun out wit' the quickness 

shot the bank teller so it wouldn't be a witness 

fled out the door with the money in my left hand 

still in my right hand running like a wild man 

ran to the hide-a-way knowing they was after me 

burned out my id stole a jeep Cherokee 

couldn't be late for my trip to Jamaica 

heading to the river skeeming up on how to take a 

boat from a victim, rush right up and stick him 

with a sharp object making sure that I get him 

put it to the river, see, nervous as a lunatic 

jumped out of the veichle as borrowed me a boat quick 

jumped on with the gun, soughter on the break and run 

shot with the gat, in the back, like in Vietnam 

quickly making waves in the river as I ran fast 

got a mile in the boat ran out of gas

where I saw the right on time, now it's time for the crime 

do the crime waste no time then I'm going to get mine 

waited for the door to open shot the first trick I saw 

then shot the other fool I ain't thinking 'bout no law 

jumped in the truck put the pedal to the medal 

then fired up a square man doing about 1-10 

looking in my rear-view 5-0 everywhere 

messing up my plans with them helicopters in the air 

headed for the airport, wait I see a road block

reached for artillery, put the shank in my mouth 

dove off the boat to the river and I bailed out 

swam like a fish greeted land with a kiss 

did I hit or did I miss well it goes like this 

I put the money in the spot 

took the clothes that I got 

tied them up in the bag same place I put the mask

Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica 

thinking about why I took the money for the faka 

me living poor and wishing to be richer 

and me like Picasso I had to paint a picture 

of people dying rapidly, trying to imprison me 

just because I took a little money in a robbery 

landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads 

smoking on the gunja messing with my head 

the feds came behind me hit me with a billy club 

I fell to the ground, turned around pumping slugs 

jumped up quick, ditched the gun as I ran away 

ran to the hills where I hid for a few days 

no, I'm not the one that they will catch soon 

bought me a palace in the hills wit' a hundred rooms 

I got the money, got the women, got the be	-you-D

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Pra aquele sertão afora
Meu berrante ia tocando

No caminho desta vida
Muito espinho encontrei
Mais nenhum calou mais fundo
Do que isso que eu passei
Na minha viage de volta
Quarqué coisa eu cismei,
Vendo a porteira fechada
E o menino não avistei

A piei do meu cavalo
Num ranchinho beira chão,
Vi uma muié chorando
Quis sabê qual a razão

Boiadeiro veio tarde,
Veja a cruz no estradão
Quem matou o meu filhinho
Foi um boi sem coração

Lá pra banda de ouro fino
Levando o gado servage
Quando eu passo na porteira
Até vejo sua imagem
O seu rangido tão triste
Mai parece uma mensagem
Daquele rosto trigueiro
Desejando me boa viagem

A cruzinha do estradão
Do pensamento não sai
Eu já fiz um juramento
Que eu não esqueço jamais
Nem que o meu gado estore
Que eu preciso ir atrás
Nesse pedaço de chão
Berrante eu não toco mais",O Menino da Porteira,

Tonico e Tinoco,"Cada vez que me alembro
Do amigo Chico Mineiro
Das viage que nois fazia
Era ele meu companheiro

Sinto uma tristeza
Uma vontade de chorar
Alembrando daqueles tempos
Que não mais há de voltar

Apesar de eu ser patrão
Eu tinha no coração
O amigo Chico Mineiro
Caboclo bom decidido
Na viola era dolorido e era o peão dos boiadeiro

Hoje porém com tristeza
Recordando das proeza
Da nossa viage motin

Viajemo mais de dez anos
Vendendo boiada e comprando
Por esse rincão sem fim

Caboclo de nada temia
Mas porém, chegou um dia
Que Chico apartou-se de mim

Fizemos a última viagem
Foi lá pro sertão de Goiás
Fui eu e o Chico Mineiro
Também foi o capataz

Viajamos muitos dias
Pra chegar em Ouro Fino
Aonde nós passemo a noite
Numa festa do Divino

A festa tava tão boa
Mas antes não tivesse ido
O Chico foi baleado
Por um homem desconhecido

Larguei de comprar boiada
Mataram meu companheiro
Acabou-se o som da viola
Acabou-se o Chico Mineiro

Despois daquela tragédia
Fiquei mais aborrecido
Não sabia da nossa amizade
Porque nois dois era unido

Quando vi seu documento
Me cortou meu coração
Vim saber que o Chico Mineiro
Era meu legítimo irmão",Chico Mineiro,2004
Tonico e Tinoco,"Nestes verso tão singelo
Minha bela, meu amor
Pra você quero contar
O meu sofre e a minha dor
Eu sou que nem sabiá
Quando canta é só tristeza
Desde o gaio onde ele está

Nesta viola eu canto e gemo de verdade
Cada toada representa uma saudade

Eu nasci naquela serra
Num ranchinho beira chão
Tudo cheio de buraco
Donde a lua fai clarão
Quando chega a madrugada
Lá no mato a passarada
Principia um baruião

Nesta viola eu canto e gemo de verdade
Cada toada representa uma saudade

Vou parar com a minha viola já não posso mai cantar,
Pois o jeca quando canta tem vontade de chorar
O choro que vai caindo
Devagá se sumindo, como as água vão pro mar",Tristeza Do Jeca,
Tonico e Tinoco,"Na viola eu pegava pra vê se consolava disso que aconteceu
A viola só gemia, parece que ela dizia Chico Mineiro morreu
Quando eu via uma boiada levantar poeira na estrada e o grito dos boiadeiros
De tristeza até chorava pra mim me representava grito de Chico Mineiro

Acabrunhado eu vivia de noite já nem dormia sempre triste a soluçar
Da grande dor que eu sentia por dentro me remoía resolvi me vingar
Peguei o trinta embalado na sinta o punhal fiado e sai com o destino
De encontrar com o valentão que matou o meu irmão no sertão de Ouro Fino

Topei com esse malvado, um cabra mal encarado na hora desafiei
Ele veio pro meu lado eu com o punhal afiado em seu peito lhe cravei
Deixei o cara estendido, no derradeiro gemido pra Deus eu perdi perdão
Que eu fiz isto por vingança chorando a triste lembrança da morte do meu irmão",Vinganca Do Chico Mineiro,

I don't like your tiny thinking
I won't fight your stinking war
You start something this time
We all get a half-life
Go figure it out on your own
And it's all in the name of Democracy
Or it's all in the name of the state
But you can name it your mammy
Name it when I'm through
You know it all works out the same
You must be insane

Are you men associated with the American army
No we're not associated with anybody",Trouble,1980
Tonio K.,"She was looking good
She was a beautiful girl
From a tenth generation American dream world
To look at her you'd never guess
That she could hurt so bad in such a beautiful dress
'cause
1. she had the perfect smile
2. she'd been the perfect child
3. she looked as if she had it all
She was a living doll

She'd been looking around for a new situation
Beyond sex and short-term stimulation
'cause everyone she'd ever known
Had treater her like something they owned, so
1. she played the little girl
2. she was afraid of the whole wide world
3. she felt so helpless and so small
She was living doll

She'd never been given a minute of love
Unless she met the conditions
And it made her so mad that her heart froze up
And the pain turned into a prison

It was a miracle when she came to life
When true love cut through the pain like a knife
Now when the coast is clear and the past is buried
Who knows, she might even get married
1. she kinda met this guy
2. he ain't perfect but he's alright
3. now she can't wait for him to call
4. he kinda likes her too
5. she ain't perfect but he says she'll do
6. he keepers her picture on the wall
'cause he thinks she's a living doll",Living Doll,1986
Tonio K.,"In a perfect world it would never end like this
There'd be something we could do
In a perfect world lovers wake up with a kiss
And their wishes all come true
But here we are I thought you belonged to me
It seemed like the perfect arrangement
Ain't it funny when you find how wrong you can be

Oh this ain't no perfect world
I've got my problems
No this ain't no perfect world
You've got your problems too
Now what do we do

In a perfect world I'd have been the boy you need
I'd have been somebody else
In a perfect world you'd have been the girl for me
You could have been yourself
We're dying for love but we're not afraid to drop our guard
We're lost in a world gone crazy
Where the men won't grow up and the women get so hard

I don't know if we'll wind up friends
I don't know if we'll wind up strangers
Cause I've never had to walk away from anybody
I wanted as much as you",Perfect World,1986
Tonio K.,"It's a jungle out there
Used to be a garden
But the times got rough
And now all those innocent hears have hardened
You've got Cain and Abel
You've got Jack and Jill
They're out looking for love
On a Saturday night in a coup de ville

But love got twisted
And the streets got mean
Now everybody's got their secret
As the night comes down like a guillotine

True confessions
In a twisted world

Its just you and me baby
In the danger zone
We're out looking for permanent love
In the middle of a city full of broken homes
Where all the boys want to use you
And all the girls want to cry
And nothing works like it used to
And you can't remember your lines

I heard about a housewife sleeping in the wrong bed
Head a rumor that Elvis has risen from the dead
I've seen a lot of lovers been programmed to lose
Seen a civilization proclaiming the blues",True Confessions,1986
Tonio K.,"He said
Ain't this some congregation
Ain't this some kind of crowd
They spit in the eye of creation
They're so educated and proud
Their plans are outrageous
And the tales are so tall
The conversation's contagious

But the talk is so small
The sidewalks and the streets are overflowing with dread
And every night down here's the night of the living dead

You don't belong here
You know it's true
You look all wrong here
You don't know how to act or what to do
But you know sometimes I think I don't belong here too

She said
It's like walking through fire
It's like shedding your skin
You throw your clothes out the window
You face the person within
It's like dying in public
It's like learning to fly
Leaving the world behind you
It's like being born twice

He said ""you're probably right all right, but this is my home""
She said ""what kind of home is that, living on death row""

You don't belong here
You're just passing through
You won't last long here
Man you're just not that cruel
And I'm gonna say a prayer that you're gonna leave here soon

He thought he was the king of the world
He was walking around in rags
She told him who the king of the world really was
She told him to pack his bags

It was a Saturday night
It was the end of the world
It was a fantastic fight
It was impressing the girls
It was impressing the Russians
Even impressed the Chinese
It had 'em running for cover
It had 'em down on their knees
The enemy broke the code and surrounded the building at dawn
But they had disappeared mysteriously
Meanwhile the war rages on ...",You Don't Belong Here,1986

It's a long time coming but I wait anyway
Till the dark clouds have all blown away
And the sun shines again

I keep trying; I've been holding on
Though the days are empty in a world that's gone wrong 
Life's a miracle or a foolish tale
I don't know, 
Go ask Shakespeare

Love's the answer like I said before
It's the one thing we needed maybe now even more
Love's the secret we've been looking for
Till the sun shines again

So I keep hoping; and I'm holding on
There a cold wind blowing but I know love is strong
There will come a day when the sorrow is gone 
And the sun shines again

Que esta noche de farra y de alegría
El dolor de mi alma quiero ahogar

Es la última farra de mi vida
De mi vida muchachos que se va
Mejor dicho se ha ido tras de aquella
Que no supo mi amor nunca apreciar

Yo la quise, muchachos y la quiero
Y a ella jamás yo la podré olvidar
Yo me emborracho por ella
Y ella quien sabe que hará

Eche mozo más champán
Que todo mi dolor
Bebiendo quiero ahogar
Si la ven, amigos, díganle
Que ha sido por su amor
Que mi vida ya se fue

Y brindemos, no más, la última copa
Que tal vez, ella ahora lo estará
Ofreciendo en algún brindis su boca
Y otra boca feliz la besará

Eche amigo, no más, échele y llene
Hasta el borde la copa de champán

[ VERSE 1: Hi-see ]
Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
Thought about my girl with the big fat breast
So I called her up and asked could I see her today
She said okay, so I said, ""I see ya Shante""
Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
Put on my chain and my boots and things
Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
She said, ""Gimme the place and time and we could hook up""
I said, ""Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
At a quarter to five, cause at six it get dark""
She said she didn't mind, okay it's on
So I grabbed my Skanless jacket, then I hung up the phone
I stepped out the house, smilin and grinnin
Sayin to myself, hot damn I'm winnin

[ CHORUS ]
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Sittin in the park waitin for you
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Shall I slap the trick and tell the tramp it's through?
I'm (sitting in the park waiting for you)

[ VERSE 2: Hi-see ]
On the way to the park I had to stop at the sto'
When bums beg me for a quarter I usually say no
But that day I made all they butt holler
Went in my pocket, gave the poor fellas a dollar
They couldn't believe it, they had to ask me what's wrong
I said, ""Yo, just take this dollar and get yo butt on""
I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
Mmh... what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they panty hose
And never never have I ever bought a chick no rose
But that day I had to be the Life Saver
To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
But all I thought about was just knockin her boots
I thought about doin it with no hesitation
Now I'm sittin in the park just waitin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Hi-see ]
Now I'm sittin on a bench with my back against the fence
Hi-see's not dumb, I got a gang of sense
Flowers in my hand, ice cream in a cup
I'm thinkiin to myself, won't this girl hurry up?
I seen my homies comin and my butt puckered up
They said, ""There go the homie Crawf, hey Hi-see, what's up?""
I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back
But I was stuck in a - ouch - caught in the act
Then a old man walked up to me
He said, ""You know, whatever will be, will be""
I said, ""Excuse me sir, I don't mean to be rude
( ? ) I'm in a bad mood""
He said, ""Look like you got yourself a few problems
Why me bein a old man, maybe I can solve em""
""Pops, that sound familiar, what shall I do?""
""Well, just slap that trick and tell the tramp it's through""
