Dolly Parton,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying the stairway to heaven",Stairway to Heaven,2002
Dolly Parton,"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife

I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me

And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.

From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea

From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say

That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me

And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free

Dolly Parton,"Oh, say can you see,
By the dawn's early light 
What so proudly we hailed 
At the twilight's last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, 
Through the perilous fight 
O'er the ramparts we watched, 
Were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket's red glare, 
The bombs bursting in air 
Gave proof through the night 
That our flag was still there 
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?",The Star Spangled Banner,2003
Dolly Parton,"Peace in the valley for me some day

Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes

Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
And there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only will be peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Yes, there will be peace, sweet peace in the valley for me, oh, yes",There Will Be Peace in the Valley for Me,2003

Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone

Dolly Parton,"(Rodney Crowell)

She's a rounder I can tell you that 
She can sing 'em all night, too 
She'll raise hell about the sleep she lost 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Especially cowgirls, they're the gypsy kind 
And need their laid on 'em loose 
She's lived to see the world turned upside down 
Hitchin' rides out of the blues 

But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been 

Lonely nights are out there on the road 
Motel ceiling stares you down 
There must be safer ways to pay your dues 
But even cowgirls get the blues 

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like she's too far gone 
The only way she's ever been 

Even cowgirls get the blues sometime 
Bound to don't know what to do sometimes 
Get this feelin' like the restless wind 
The only way she's ever been

Dolly Parton,"Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill

Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that

Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee

Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will

Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee

Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again

Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me

Dolly Parton,"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who 
I use to take comfort from long before I met you 
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire 
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire 
Old flames can't hold a candle to you 

No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love 
I've known one or two 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 

Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known 
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone 
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone 
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn 

Old flames can't hold a candle to you 
No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love

But old flames can't hold a candle to you

Dolly Parton,"I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (Baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
well Maybe just one little kiss more (Put some music on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say no, no, no, sir (Mind if I move a little closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really can't stay (Baby don't hold out)
Ah, but it's cold outside)

C'mon baby

I simply must go (Baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (Ooh baby, it's cold outside)
This welcome has been (I'm lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Man, your lips look so delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
Well maybe just one little kiss more (Never such a blizzard before)

I've got to go home (You'll freeze to the bone out there)
Say, lend me your comb (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (Your eyes are like starlight now)
But don't you see (How can you do this thing to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Making my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (Get over that old out)
Ahh, but it's cold outside

Baby it's cold outside

Brr its cold

The stars will agree
They all heard you promise

I know that it's true

And what about all of those warm tender nights
Did they mean nothing to you

Did you think i could just put your memory behind

I'm gonna have me some fun

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,2005
Dolly Parton,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend

We'd live the life we choose

For we were young and sure to have our way

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild

Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away

And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down

Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.

Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.

And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together

And sing a chorus or two

Lord I like to work boy 
I'm rolling all the time
I can pop my initials 

Right on a mule's behind
Well it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
Lord it's hey little water boy bring your water 'round
And if you don't like your job just set that water bucket down

I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I've got three women on Saturday night 
Waiting to draw my pay

Well I'm going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I'm going to town baby what can I bring you back
Just bring a pint of good rye 
And a John B.Stetson hat

Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it's raining here and it's storming on the deep blue sea
Can't no blonde headed woman make a monkey out for me
If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round

If your house catches fire and there ain't no water 'round
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
Well I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes
I'm leaving here and I ain't gonna take no clothes

Dolly Parton,"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone

Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure

Countrified and country-fed

'Cause I'm country to the core

Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives

Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe

And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through

Oh, that's country!

Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways

I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could

Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was

Dolly Parton,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

As the mighty river flows,
As the meadow gaily plays
With the wind on summer days.

About as deep as deep can go,
From the canyons to the sky,
Like a mother as she cares
For the baby that she bares.

Do I love you, don’t you know by now?
Do I love you, must I show you how?
Do I love you, do I have to say?
Do I love you, yes, in every way.

About as sacred as an hymn
And the Bible full of pearls
From a whisper to a roar
Very much and even more.

Let me say it with my eyes,
And I’ll share it with the night
Even in death the good Lord is kind
You’ll be the last thing on my mind.

Dolly Parton,"What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start
The way you always do?

When somebody knocks at the door
Someone new walks in
I will smile and shake their hands
but you can't make old friends

You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
But you can't make old friends

How will I sing when you are gone?
Cause it wont sound the same
Who will join in on those harmony parts
When I call your name?

You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
But you can't make old friends

When Saint Peter opens the gate
And you come walking in
I will be there just waiting for you
Cause you can't make old friends
Cause you can't make old friends

When I am out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
But you can't make old friends

You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
And you and me, will be young again
You can't make old friends

You and me, will be together again
Cause we both know, we will still be old friends

You can't make old friends
Not the way we have always been",You Can't Make Old Friends,2013
Dolly Parton,"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now

When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright

There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright

But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore

Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright

Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell

But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time

Dolly Parton,"Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down on the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is a magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sounds of crickets and the katydids
It's called ho-o-ome
On the front porch swingin'
And the fern pots hangin'
Ho-o-ome
With the church bells ringin'
And voices singin'
Those old songs that mend my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love complete
Oh me, I wanna go ho-o-ome
I often think about where I have been
Where I am goin' and that's about when I think about
Ho-o-ome
Where the soul finds comfort and the heart finds pleasure
Ho-o-ome
Where the depths of love is hard to measure
It's ho-o-ome
I hear you callin', I hear you callin'
I'll never be lost as long as I know
There's place like that where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes in the soft blue smoke
Of ho-o-ome
Home sweeet home. Ho-o-ome
Back to the hills with the whippoorwills
Of ho-o-ome
With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin'
Ho-o-ome
Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine
At ho-o-ome
Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome
With family and friends and joy that never ends
Ho-o-ome
There's no place like it, no place like it
Ho-ome",Home,2014

Dolly Parton,"All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rules
But, baby, I broke them all for you
Because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess
No, they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what

Dolly Parton,"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who 
I used to take comfort from long before I met you 
I caught a spark in his eyes of forgotten desire 
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire 

But old flames can't hold a candle to you 
No one can light up the night like you do 
Flickering embers of love 
I've known one or two 
But old flames can't hold a candle to you 

Oh yeah
Ooh ooh

Like sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known 
And I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone (feel so alone)
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone 
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn 

But old flames can't hold a candle to you

After everything we've been through, what's left to prove

At oncoming trains ahead

Watching our love hang by a thread

The car is parked in the rotary
Cover your eyes, repeat after me

Your child is still asleep in the hall
Her dreams have lit up the interstate wall
In the rear-view mirror now you're an apple doll

This motel is celebrating age
The parking lot wind smells like sage
Your headlights shoot out into the desert like rage

The radio finally hits its stride
The sun comes up in a hundred miles
You'll lay your hands down at your sides

It's mind over matter now
Everyone I know thinks it's a joke
A second chance comes around
A second chance, a second chance

When I first met you, your eyes were dry
These walls only help to remind me

It's once down the stairs
Twice on your back
The bruises laid out in a line
A second chance, a second chance

Open your eyes, open your eyes
Open your eyes, open your eyes

I did not hear a word you said
It's mind over matter now

It's back down to simple pleasure again
The well-laid plan has worn thin
It's time to put it down

Well, courage comes and courage goes
Till somebody takes a hand
And slaps some sense in me
Right now my chest is gonna explode
If I don't put it down

Get back to the simple pleasure
The simple reasons again
And all the unspoken hours
Side by side with you, my friends
It's simple pleasure again

Mistakes can all be justified
But you'd think by now I'd give in
You'll never know how hard I tried
Yeah, but I just can't put it down

'Cause it's the simple pleasure
Simple reasons again
And all the unspoken hours
Side by side with you, my friend

And all the unspoken hours
Side by side with you, my friend

On your block for another hearse

To the arms of your wet nurse

Props you up to look your best
Once on your feet
All roads lead to the medicine chest

Where the Mississippi turns flat and wide
We'd lay out on the sandbars 
And fall asleep to the barges and the fireflies
And I killed my true love from Hannibal
She was nineteen and I was twenty-two
Summer was ending and she was leaving soon 
To study writing on the east coast
And I worked in my father's shop 
Fixing air conditioners and heating pumps
Going to college never made much sense to me 
I wanted to keep my true love close to me

The summers are hot in Hannibal 
The summers there are unbearable
So we'd steal down to the water's edge 
And cool off in the river's ebb
One night we decided what we would do 
Swim to the middle ‘til our strength gave out
Where the current was strong and deep 
Together we'd be pulled down to sleep
So we swam ‘til our bodies were weak
I watched my true love get washed out to sea
I felt a terrible grip from beneath
The river took her but it didn't take me

In St. Louis there's a prison cell 
It'll be twelve more years ‘til I get out
When I do her father says he'll shoot me down 
If I don't do it myself

Dolorean,"And you might be surprised 
By how much I love you
And the coals that burn white in my chest
And you might be surprised 
By how oft' I think of you
But ambition has encamped around me
Dark toothed obsession has taken your place

Open your eyes 
You are better than me
Selfish and pitied your man has become
You can't recognize 
I'm too far to be reached
And my gaze looks beyond your face
And my heart has turned greyed and dull

So do not love one 
Who can't love you as much
Go ahead and turn this dog loose
And do not think of one 
Who does not think of you

Find another who can love you strong
Let not my dark clouds spoil your dawn",Spoil Your Dawn,2003
Dolorean,"Brown grass and peeling paint 
Dirty glass of lemonade
And your back's about to break 
Cause it's more than you can take
Is that what you were talking to Jesus about? 
All those things you can't figure out
You've been chasing those dreams for so long now
But your devotion turns to doubt
And the people you hoped you would meet 
But you're still here with me

When you lay down by my side 
When the lights are all out
You've got no corners where you can hide 
Especially from yourself
And you kiss like a corpse 
And you smile like a crow
And my threads are too short 
When your wounds are exposed
And the places you hoped you would see 
But you're still here with me

And I sleep with your ghost 
The dotted outline of what you were
But what I miss most 
Is when you'd draw near
Cause this house would rattle and shake 
When we'd stay up late
And the grass was green and the glasses were clean
And these walls were covered with brand new white paint
And the person you thought you'd be 
But you're still here with me

Dolorean,"It wasn't my fault 
She led me here 
Canadian plains 
To disappear
It started one night 
When I'd had too much 
Of being alone 
Of collecting dust
So I went to see her 
Like a thief in the night 
I gave her my death 
And stole from her life
And it killed me each time 
That I saw her man 
A friend of mine 
If you could call me a friend
And on Sunday morning 
The preacher preached on deceit 
He spoke of a fire 
Of unspeakable heat
So now I drive 
Cross frozen plains 
Nowhere to hide 
Just to escape

I traded it all 
To match my desire 
I traded it all 
I traded for fire
I traded for fire

And Father forgive me 
Because I knew 
What I was doing
I set a snare 
For myself and fell headlong 
Into ruin
Don't let me settle 
Down in a small northern town 
To die
Burn my lips 
With coals and burn my insides",Traded for Fire,2003

You're everywhere, baby
On my bike ride your hips are the hills
I can't escape you lately

I wanted to tell you
About a bright red bird that passed my train
But you're asleep tonight
And your tonight is my yesterday

And all those blues because there's no view
Of the city from your window
You've made a nest out of credit card bills
So honey, let the wind blow

My feet have grown so tired
My legs they ache each night
Because you know the hardest thing to do
Is to dance in step in each other's shoes

We drop the beat
We can't keep time
We're standing still
In my still life

To help me get over you
And I've grown quite fond of what
One bottle can do

Puts me sleep without a dream
Without a thought of anything
And when I wake day's half-way done
It's time to start another one

So, I drink one bottle of wine each night
To help me get over you
And I've grown quite fond of what
One bottle can do

And I go beyond where the tears come
Way past the urge to just pick up the phone
My mind's a blank it's better off that way
Whatever it takes to feel okay

So, I drink one bottle of wine each night
To help me get over you
And I've grown quite fond of what
One bottle can do

And till the real things you feel like returning
You know that mink won't keep you warm

Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun

You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,

I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister
Oh you can't get a man with a gun

In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.

For a gal who he thinks is fun.

When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a peeping one by one.

Sweet dreams will ever take me Home.

Is that the way we stand
Were you lying all the time
Was it just a game to you

Once set our footprints when you carried me along

Dom DeLuise,"I like butterflies with big golden wings
And blue and green tips, me too
I like swiss-cheese ice cream
Me too, me too

You too, too? Wait a minute
What's your favorite book?
Hmm, The Brothers Karl Maxoff
The brothers, I can't believe it
I can't believe it

I can tell we've got an awful lot in common
Even though we look as different as can be
We don't even have to try to see things eye to eye
It just comes to us, naturally

Come to think of it, I think we fit together
Playing cat and mouse won't get us, very far
There's no need to feud and fuss
When it isn't really us, let's you and me be who we are

We're a duo, a duo, a pair of lonely ones
Who were meant to be a two
Oh, a duo, it's true-o
Wherever we go, we're going me and you

No matter what, now, we've got one another
We'll be be there to pick each other off the floor
Anytime you're feeling glum
Count on me to be a chum

If ya get an itch attack
I'll be there to scratch your back
Now who could ever ask for more

Oh stop, oh stop, no, don't stop
More, more, we're friends
And that's what friends are for

We're a duo, a duo, a pair of lonely ones
Who were might to be a two
Oh, a duo, it's true-o

If we're ever in a stoop
We know we can make it through
'Cuz you've got me and I've got you
Yes, sir

Whole squad getting checks, you'll never know that feeling

Cell phones up, tell them girls to shoot me
All I hear is ""yea bitch that's Dom can you excuse me""

Had some iceberg and I used to want that Coogi
Back in 97 man my uncle wore the Gucci
And he rocked Polo, and he wore the Stussy
I am no marine but these niggas do salute me
Catch me on Pico, I am like the Lucy's
Give it to em raw, I am like the sushi
I hate how rappers use the term ""fresh"" so loosely
Bad ass nigga, I am like Boosie
But that just might have went over yo head like a kufi
If I was a DJ, I would be Brucie
Or any of them niggas Biggie shouted out on ""Juicy""
Sometime I get chose, but you can say I'm choosy
And if you want to keep her then you should not introduce me
25th hour, that was introducing
Roll wit the winners girl cause I ain't into losing
Talking Crenshaw king, that's what we be cruising
Get my point across, so I never have to prove it
Squab wit a nigga, I ain't into shootin
This is not the army but them niggas is recruiting
Hardwood floors, but we don't be hooping

I'm a student, but now everyday they call my name and I be truant

Growing up, never got a slow day

Pull up to the function with a slow creep
Leave with a girl that's popping, keep it low key

Dom Kennedy,"Now I’m in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
every night in front of a new crowd
That’s new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I cant, no, I won`t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now (ow, ow)

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I’m like glue, I stick to other artists
I’m not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you (at all)
You need me, but, I don’t need you

You need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you
You need me, but, I don’t need you (at all)
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don’t need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer you’re just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit’s cool
I will blast and I didn’t go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last if I’m smoking on a crack pipe

And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, (at all)
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, (at all)
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I’ll be aiming it right
I won’t stop till my name’s in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I’m on Arabian Nights
Because I’m young and all my brother’s gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The game’s over but now I’m on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I’m bound to blow up
I’ve done around about a thousand shows
But I haven’t got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I’m singing them out
(Wow)
From day one, I’ve been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I’m back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
‘Cause it’s another day
Plus I’ll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD’s from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD’s from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I’m still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I’m still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I’m always doing shows if I’m not I’m in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I’m up and coming like I’m fucking in an elevator.

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you, (at all)
You need me, man, I don’t need you

Aqueles olhos
Aqueles olhos
Que refletem luz no meu coração

Amor verdade, brilho, saudade
Me encontrava ali pensando, mano e sem maldade
Meu remédio contra o medo, me deixa sem estresse
Seu olhar, tudo que eu preciso a luz que me aquece
Entre becos e vielas, entre a paz e o perigo
E você ali sorrindo de mãos dadas comigo
A gente se abraça, minha mão no seu cabelo eu ponho
Mas adivinha, eu acordei e era só um sonho!

No meu pensamento sei que vai ficar
A todo momento sei que vou lembrar
Do brilho dos teus olhos

Fecho os olhos não consigo te esquecer
Tem alguém comigo mais não é você
Tenho até medo de dormir pra não lembrar

Daqueles olhos (daqueles olhos)
Aqueles olhos (inconfundíveis olhos)

Despertava, levantava, não te via
Voltava pra cama
Pra ver se sonhava
Com aquela fita que eu imaginava
Aquela que me motiva
Aquela que me faz seguir em frente
Aquela que quando eu fecho os olhos
Te enxergo na minha frente
Sua boca, seu olhar
Seu sorriso, seu cheiro doce
Afrodite da quebrada, ela chique, como se fosse
Várias fita acontecendo, e eu no meio sofrendo junto
Se aparecia, e eu num mol função
Mais se conseguia tranquilizar tudo
Eu esquecia do mundo
Me paralisava, só queria ir pro alto e avante
Esquecia dos mano e das mina
Com você só queria ir adiante
Te via lá de cima do morro aumentava mais meu desejo
Pergunta pra Deus o diretor
Quando vai ser nossa cena do beijo
Seu olhar me intimida, seu cheiro
Seu jeito simpático, não sei mais o que eu faço
Posso ser um anjo ou um mágico
Te olhava 'cê disfarçava, depois me olhava de relance
Mais meu sonho se realizaria
Se você me desse uma chance

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

And there's a boat on the river

And the thunder roared 
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered and a moaned

And then the ferryman said
There is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now

You must pay me now

Un paraíso de ternura, de pasión

Con los ojos cerrados, amándonos, volando en un beso
Viviendo este amor que es tan puro y real
Este amor que se puede tocar

Con los ojos cerrados, enamorados
Soñando despiertos sin miedo
A que nadie nos pueda separar
A jurar que lo nuestro es eterno amor

Con el fuego de tus ojos negros
No había sentido nada así
Me has dado ganas de vivir
Me has concebido la fortuna
De llegar hasta la luna

Dominator,"When you are ready, I will surrender
Take me and do as you will
Have what you want, your way's always the best way
I have succumbed to this passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am the zombie, your wish will command me
Laugh as I fall to my knees

Can I control this empty delusion?
Lost in the fire below
And you come running your eyes will be open
And when you come back, I'll be as you want me
Only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me
Thinking your name as I sing

(Sing it back to me)
(Sing it back to me)

No, you can't help it if you have been tempted
By fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And I feel useless
Don't care what the truth is
You will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me?
Don't try to come near me
So tired I sleep through the lie
If you desire to lay here beside me
Come to my sweet melody

La sabrosura rica y sandunguera
Que Puerto Rico puede dar

Lo le lo lai, lo le lo lai, lo le lo la
Yo la reparto por dónde quiera
En valles montes y las praderas

Con mi cantar rico y sin igual
Al que me escucha lo pongo a gozar
Al que me escucha lo pongo a gozar, hey

Del paraíso de la dulzura vengo yo
Que esto sí que es sabrosura
De adónde vengo
Es del paraiso e' dulzura

A la la eh, mi socio

Borinquén la tierra del edén
La que el gran Gautier
Llamo la Perla de los Mares

Ay del paraíso es la dulzura
Puerto Rico es sabrosura
Oye de Borinquén vengo yo
Por eso tengo salsa, sabor, y control

Y ven y baila la rica plena
El rico Bombón de Elena
Mamita baila con sabrosura
Mami mueve la cintura

Lo le lo lai yo voy cantando así
Jibarito te lo jura
En mi jibarita encuentro yo
Lo aretes que le faltan a la luna

Oye esa si tiene la masa buena
Mami que la masa dura
Por eso a mi mami la quiero
Jibarito no se apura

Masa dura con pan es lo que tú tienes
Masa dura con pan el negro te quiere tú ves

Enseñarnos su belleza y marchito perecer, 
Todo tiene su final nada dura para siempret 
Tenemos que recordar que no existe eternidad.

Si no me quieres dimelo ahora,coro, 
A mi velorio no venga a llorar no no,coro,

Yo sabia que un dia tenia que acabar,coro, 
Punto final todo se acabo,coro,echa pa lante mama.

Coro, pero segui pa lante y pa lante,coro,

Domingo Quiñones,"Me tienes atontado y no puedo 
Pensar en mi trabajo y en mis deberes
Porque se me olvidan todos los encargos
Y no escucho lo que me dicen mis amigos
Ay, que calor! 
Cuando voy a volver a hacer una vida normal? 
Si estoy muerto de hambre y me olvido de cocinar

Cinco mariposas de ti 
Para vivir siempre atontado 
Parece que he fumado 
Mariposas de ti para vivir 
En todo estos presente 
Y se me vuelan los billetes
La semilla de mis dedos 
Quiere verte florecer
Quiere verte florecer

Se me vuelca todo en el pantalon
Y no puedo acordarme ninguna letra 
Que no me hable solo, tan solo, de tu olor
Y se me van los trenes a otro planeta, 
Ay que calor! 
Cuando voy a volver a hacer una vida normal? 
Si estoy muerto de hambre y me olvido de cocinar

Domingo Quiñones,"Cuelgo mi miedo en un muro de mi habitación
Me miro al espejo why siento que es momento
Exacto para dos
Quemo mis penas
Why me lanzo a la media noche como voy, como voy
Siento ardor en las venas,

Hoy voy a verte, voy a sentirte,
Hoy me decido te voy a amar
Voy a verte, voy a tenerte
Voy a dejarte huellas en la intimidad
Voy a verte, voy a tenerte
Vas a tener mi vida en la intimidad, en la intimidad
Luces que viajan por lo oscuro de mi corazón

calles desiertas quedan en un sueño, vuelo de neón
Quemo mis penas

Siento ardor en las venas,
Why me lanzo a la media noche como voy, como voy
Hoy voy a verte, voy a sentirte,

hoy me decido te voy a amar
Voy a verte, voy a tenerte
Voy a verte, voy a tenerte
Voy a dejarte huellas en la intimidad

Quiero llenar la casa de todas mis fantasías

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

North and South and East and West of your life

What you gonna be and they sold me 
The American Dream for a small fee 
The price of my life and my own dreams 
What about a dream where the Kingdom comes 
Peace on the earth and his will be done 

What about a dream where the people fight 
Not for fortune and fame but for saving lives
She'll consume your future if you just let her be 
Hold the world a hostage From sea to shining sea
You can call her freedom, but she can't set you free 
And don't you dare disgrace her She's our American dream

American dream, I was never told that the high life 
Would demand my soul such a high price 
I've been drinking the Kool-Aid the whole time 
Believing the dream till it stole mine 
What about a dream where the people cry 
For the healing of a land both soul and mind 
What about a dream where the dream was changed 

Not for change sake but for the highest gain
They say cash rules everything around me it seems 
For thirty pieces of silver you can buy you a king 
And forfeit your soul become a slave to the machine 
Some would sell they're own momma for the American pipe dream 
Redemption disregarded to the good news imparted 
Exempt from consequence spiritual free-dumb to free-tarded 
Morally decayed selfish in my ways I live to get paid

Program youth then program the future

Till I pledge my allegiance to lose my mind",American Dream,2011

From someone´s wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you´re young you find inspiration
In anyone who´s ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

´Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you´re not careful
You´ll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I´d bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

And we were never being boring

You could always rely on a friend

In rented rooms and foreign places

But I thought in spite of dreams
You´d be sitting somewhere here with me

Dominic Miller,"I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall",Desert Rose,2001

Morning, Doc
So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?
Anxious
Anxiety?
Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world, nervous
Nervous? Come on, Marshall, you're a big boy now, sounding like a bit of a baby
You can do this; you found a sponsor yet?
Um, not yet, I mean, but when I get back
Well, if you find one, you find one; if you don't, you don't
Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and
Wait, what?
Well, I mean you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
And it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule
I know you're a busy person
Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing?
So what else are you thinking?
Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps
And, I mean, learning them, and start being able to apply them
The steps?
Yeah, the steps
There's a lot of them, aren't there?
Well, twelve
Christ, I don't even know them all
Really?
Anything else?
Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
Take a drink
What?
Take a drink and, you know, take the edge off
Take the edge off?
Man, if I ever take a drink, I already know what that's gonna lead me to
What, you mean these?

"Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist","Hallelujah, the Five Joyful Mysteries
The First Joyful Mystery, The Annunciation 
The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth
And coming to Mary, he said, ""Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you"" (Lk 1:26-28)
We pray for the virtue of faithfulness to prayer
Mary prays faithfully in her solitude 
Her “yes” welcomes the indwelling Trinity
May our prayer always be a “yes” to God”

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil, amen

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee
Blessed art thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus
Holy Mary, Mother of God

O my Jesus, forgive us our sins 
Save us from the fires of hell 
Lead all souls to heaven 
Especially those who have the most need of Thy mercy

The Second Joyful Mystery, The Visitation  
Mary set out and traveled to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth 
When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb 
And Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said 
""Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb"" (Lk 1:39-45)

We pray for the virtue of charity 
Mary’s charity in visiting her cousin Elizabeth 
Enabled their sons to meet mystically in their mothers’ wombs 
Charity is always realized by unity

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us

Lead all souls to heaven 
Especially those who have the most need of Thy mercy

The Third Joyful Mystery, The Birth of Our Lord 
Mary gave birth to her firstborn son 
She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger
And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying 
""Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests” (Lk 2:1-20)

We pray for the virtue of generosity 
This virtue opens the door to the revelation of God’s presence in another person 
And through our generous gift of self, we bow before His presence in other people

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses

The Fourth Joyful Mystery, The Presentation in the Temple
Mary and Joseph took the baby Jesus to the temple to present him to the Lord 
In the temple Simeon and Anna came forward, gave thanks to God 
And spoke about Jesus to all who were present (Lk 2:22-38)

We pray for the virtue of purity 
This enables us to allow God to have free reign in our hearts

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread

The Fifth Joyful Mystery, The Finding of the Child Jesus In the Temple 
The boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it 
After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers
Listening to them and asking them questions (Lk 2:41-50)

We pray for the virtue of zeal for souls

Comme autant de collines occultant l'horizon
De crêtes insensibles à l'adagio des plaines

Qui entre dans tes murs et saigne les baleines
Te fait des mois durant dédaigner l'horizon

Tant tu aimes goûter au sang de la baleine
Qui déborde des lèvres de la femme au harpon.

Les yeux exorbités, il te dit, ""Repartons"".
Il est temps de sortir du sommeil des reines
Car nul ne vous attend autant que l'horizon.

Et tu entends au loin les plaintes des baleines
Qui avant de finir sur la grève ont sans doute
Connu cet horizon dont seul le capitaine
Espère encore pour deux que tu croises la route.

Mais un jour au silence qui monte aux alentours
Comme tes yeux se décollent, tu sais qu'on t'a laissé
Seul avec ton vieux rêve dont l'ombre est un vautour
Qui dessous tes haillons sent la chair s'assécher

Et comme en de lents cercles, il va pour t'entreprendre

A jamais, ici ou ailleurs
C'est le velours du grand couloir
Qu'on trouverait, si on t'ouvrait le cœur"".

Au Casino qui toise les dunes
S'éveillent les machines, hoquetant,
Quelques orphelins de la lune
S'attèlent déjà consciencieusement
A cumuler de l'infortune
Un grand café serré l'attend
Près des machines qui cliquètent
En entrant, il voit la moquette
Et il voit des lumières d'avant.

""Tu ne sais pas leur dire adieu
Ni à ces grandes lettres rouges
Ni au désordre des entractes
Ni aux rideaux qui vont flottant
Tu te souviens du Music Hall
De rires et de gorges serrées
Et du froissement des épaules
Et dehors, le trottoir mouillé"".

Boulevard maritime, la maison
Au cœur d'autres maisons muettes
Bouches closes une fois l'été passé
La table mise, la femme fluette
L'assiette qu'il n'y a qu'à réchauffer
Et l'hier soir qui vibre encore
Des quelques vérités brassées
Il lui pardonne sans un effort
C'était trop vrai pour le toucher.

Ils s'embrassent, elle part travailler
Elle a le pardon du fantôme
Et l'espoir indéboulonné
L'amour se cabre dans le hall
Où le souvenir l'a condamné
Avec la grande tristesse bravache
Des fins de soirées déglinguées
Où les vêtements font relâche
Et le cœur est déshabillé.

Et sous les cieux gris qui s'inquiètent
Dans les dunes ou au Casino
Parmi les machines qui hoquètent
Il regarde, il voit des cerceaux
De feu qui brunissent la moquette
Et il voit tomber des rideaux
Des mains qui claquent dans la tempête
Au dehors.

Et il voit les lettres
Rouges, et le couloir cramoisi
Et tout le possible des nuits
Qui s'affiche, rouge, en toutes lettres
Et rien de tout ça n'est fini
L'amour s'y niche, inentamé
Et tous les adieux s'y empêtrent
Comment dire adieu à la vie?

Il se souvient du music hall
Du long couloir en entonnoir
Où la foule se dévidait
Les robes ne tenant qu'à un fil
Et le sable mouillé, mouillé.",Music-Hall,2006
Dominique A,"L'amour viendra par l'ouest

L'amour viendra par l'ouest
Nous mettra sur écoutes
Il fera les cent pas

De s’être allongée dans ton lit

Pas du genre à trop s’épancher quelques mots 
Qu’elle a laissé sur ton bureau 
Quelques ratures au stylo 
Puis elle s’en est allée 
Puis elle s’en est allée 

Il nous a fallu quelques jours 
Pour être moins aveugle et sourd et trouver 
Que l’air était un peu plus lourd 
Nos épaules un peu plus rentrées et penser 
Qu’après avoir tant annoncé 
Un départ mille fois reporté, elle rêve 
Ôter le manteau du crochet 
Où depuis des siècles il pendait 
Puis s’en était allé 
Puis s’en était allé

De laisser à l’obscurité tout pouvoir

Les pièges d’une nuit trop noire 
Aux abords d’un abattoir 
Sans un poème pour nous sauver 
Sans un poème pour nous sauver

Qu’elle n’avait pas pu s’en aller, sans passer

Gettin' fucked up off the dank, CHRONIC,

It's peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for,
Makin' the proper remedy,
'cause when I hit it, bitches envy me,
You say you want wine?  Yeah I guess that's fine,
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mass,
Now my thai got a friend named Gin,
Got me all straight now my dick won't bend,
Now I'm fucked for the rest of the night,
Unless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight,
Now looka here looka here I done found a bitch,
Yummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch,
Save that shit 'cause I don't want to be your man,
Just need a little loosin', do you understand?

My mind's fucked up off chocolate thai,
Hit the gin shop now I'm so high,
Now I need a bitch that's proper and fly,
So break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie  (2x)

Thinkin' about what I'm gonna do today,
Party at my homies bout eight,
I thought about goin' to the movies,
But ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies,
Dressed like a player can't wear nothin' less,
Some simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess,
Hit a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot,
Bitches straight peepin' want to know what I got, well,
One, two, three, Here comes the D,
Pass me the rotor....WHEW WEE!!!!
And now I'm ready for you bitches,
So gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?
And so much love for y'all gals,
And peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals,
And ay, yai, yai, I'ma stay high,
And keep me a piece of that sweet potato pie

The fellas want to have a barbeque tonight, I think it's on about five,
They say it's gonna have plenty dazzey duks, and Les says it's gonna be live,
So I'ma gonna grab me a plate of soup, 'cause ain't not a damn thing changed,
And now I'm proper when fly and shit, but man do I feel strange,
So I'ma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin,
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin,
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper niece,

She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days
She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days

A.F.D., a jam that's hittin' for the streets
So flat ass is obsolete
And titties don't do it, even though they might be plump
I need a rump, the kind you can thump, so fuck her

And if it makes hits, this is much smoother
The wiggle, jiggle, jiggle, sex soother
I'm rollin' back, I'm tellin' ya now if you can't flaunt it
Take your ass home and work on it

But if you got butter on your biscuit then eat it
And, take it to my homies and feed 'em
'cause it's so good when them bitches try to serve it
Grade A beef, and it shake like it's nervous

I see some beef, take one glass
Then it turn to a spoon, put the nuts in they pants
See it at the mall and gotta grab it
So call me a hoe 'cause like the bitch I gotta have it

One hundred percent, jiggle, jiggle jelly-like anus
I like it when it's wrapped, just for a smack
I love it when it's funky decorated with a gap

So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I want that swole, word to Jimmy
Here's a little bit to think about Jack
Why, eat a pancake when you can have the whole stack?

I pick up, will call you when I get down
Don't you want it flat with a fat bumper too?
Well ain't that how you like it Mamacita?
With the boom-boom, dumpin' like Rosarita

With a place seein' ass, so do it
Remember, a serve from Domino is not the beauty but the potion
So, tap your heels like Dorothy or Doris
And listen to the theme of the chorus

She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days

I want to pump her you know? It makes you want sex when you see it
Switch it, in the night, in a tight dress
So grab Jimmy, I'm here to let you know
You think you drunk milk, the Jimmy starts to grow

Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
Sort of like drinkin', a forty ounce of liquor
I know you heard of tales from the Crypt
Well, this is more better, tales from the hip

And this is not rated P-G
It's, rated triple X and it comes in 3-D
With a bit of that soda like a treasure
But if you strike gold then you know, you'll find pleasure

Like I trunk full of body you can pounce, it's
Really like Zapp with more bounce to the ounce
So if you injured on the job then sue
You can't handle it than give it to me

Now think about it, isn't it a coincidence
Everybody wants them dead presidents?
See those that don't have it love jackin' you head to toe
And people that's clockin' a grip, always eager to make more
'cause money can help your heart, and money can help you out
But if you're makin' too much of it, then money can help you die
And ain't that scary like Jason
You can't win for losin' 'cause of the grip that you're makin'
Now this particular paper is like the power to the greedy
And a God to the hungry, keepin' life in the needy
And so we're brainwashed thinkin' of it
But don't get me wrong, 'cause I love it
I used to like George Washington's way back when
Now I'm sprung on Benjamin Franklins
And with these people I could go on
Like so on, and so on, and so on, trip
Who bought your clothes and who bought your food?
Who bought your hoe and who bought your dude?
Cut the bullshit, tell me who you tryin' to kid?
'cause you didn't buy shit, your money did
Get the picture?

There once lived a low-income woman with a child
Lookin' for single men with money she could date
Finally met a man that her daughter called Daddy
But homies comin' up short on the stakes
She let him be Daddy for awhile, 'cause the dicks good
Plus he's fine and all swole lookin' bounty
But that don't mean shit when you're broke and you're hungry
That's why daughter's Daddy's new name is Mr. County
Check, this out, they say it's the root of all evil
And I could truly say in this case
A friend of mine was makin' that big time lunch meat
But then he made a small time lunch meat mistake
'cause soon homie lost all his love for the small life
Forgot all of which he had came from before
And started gettin' greedy so another man sent a little bullet
And the bullet read ""My homie had to go""
'cause he thought....

Now do you remember, when your elders used to scream
And tell you money ain't everything
They said it couldn't buy that, and it couldn't buy this
But money bought me everything that I'm gone get
Why is it, that all the fine freaks seem to jock it?
And it keeps me smilin' when I got it in my pockets?
Got a christmas treat for my kids and a tree seen
And yes to impress them hoochie females
And since it builds up my confidence
Hurry, hurry, for the dollars and cents
As far as it goes keep it comin', and
Oh how I like it in a woman
I like to see freaks when their hair is nice
With a good wig, tight clothes, sportin' fourteen K's
Now how in the Hell do you get it?
Money, money, money, money, money, so get with it
Now it's a shame when you lame as a zero
'cause blacks, whites, as well as mexicans want dinero
And why you tryin' to win the lottery?

Don't control yourself, yeah, that's what y'all do
Wantin' more cat than my muthafuckin' dogs do
And my dogs want cat like a cat shelter, all in heat
For that piece of meat
I guess it's normal, but this is drastic
Niggas are too damned cheap to buy the rubber that's in the plastic
With the Trojan man sittin' on the box
Here's a joke, they're made for you fertile ass folks
'cause when you're unprotected and you nut
Nine months later got a gut bout to bust
And you're bitin' your fingernails 'cause you can't take care of it
That's why I'm makin' you aware of it
So I'm tellin' you chumps now, you better wack it
Or buy the jacket in a package

Chorus:

This might seem like a scapegoat,
But Domino just wants to let the homies know,
When you're thinkin' about diggin' with a deep stroke,
Don't touch the rain without a raincoat

[Second Verse]
Now where your minds at homies?  'cause the old days have passed
You need a lot more than a shot in your ass
To cure this shit of today, like gano, syphillis
And that crazy ass murderer
A-I-D, to the S, take a guess
And with a bare dick and you might take a rest
Called forever
'cause there's no cure for the bitch
Now you, now you out quick
'cause you tho\ught with your dick
But uh, who's to blame?  Say your name
And I hope it felt good the last time that you came
'cause bare dicks and clits don't mix unless you're married
And nowadays even that shits hit
'cause a bitch got a thing about fillin' that hole
So they good for the whole stroll
And she'll fuck your best friend with the quickness
So grab a five spot and buy some business

Chorus (2x)

[Third Verse]
Trick or treat, but it ain't halloween
Talkin' about kitty-kat if you know what I mean
And all you brothers that's thinkin' that you free from it
You better start peepin' it
Before you eatin' it
I know raincoats are cheap and might bust G
But soon as it pops, stop killin' them guts please!
Just because it might feel good, don't mean it's real good
Catch a disease, you'll be lucky if you heal good
And watch hoochies 'cause they seem
To let you get 'em pregnant just to tie your ass in
And remember when you met her you was a big spender
Now she takin' money out your ass like a vendin' machine
And this is because she had a little child
And now you so stressed out, you want to jump in the Nile
But, if you're careless and can't cope here's a term
Throw on a raincoat or keep your sperm in your worm

Chorus (2x)",Raincoat,1993

Gettin' fucked up off the dank, CHRONIC,

It's peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for,
Makin' the proper remedy,

You say you want wine?  Yeah I guess that's fine,
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mass,
Now my thai got a friend named Gin,
Got me all straight now my dick won't bend,
Now I'm fucked for the rest of the night,
Unless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight,
Now looka here looka here I done found a bitch,
Yummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch,
Save that shit 'cause I don't want to be your man,
Just need a little loosin', do you understand?

Hit the gin shop now I'm so high,
Now I need a bitch that's proper and fly,
So break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie  (2x)

Second Verse:

Thinkin' about what I'm gonna do today,
Party at my homies bout eight,
I thought about goin' to the movies,
But ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies,
Dressed like a player can't wear nothin' less,
Some simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess,
Hit a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot,
Bitches straight peepin' want to know what I got, well,
One, two, three, Here comes the D,
Pass me the rotor....WHEW WEE!!!!
And now I'm ready for you bitches,
So gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?
And so much love for y'all gals,
And peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals,

The fellas want to have a barbeque tonight, I think it's on about five,
They say it's gonna have plenty dazzey duks, and Les says it's gonna be live,
So I'ma gonna grab me a plate of soup, 'cause ain't not a damn thing changed,
And now I'm proper when fly and shit, but man do I feel strange,
So I'ma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin,
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin,
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper niece,
And run a little game on the P.Y.G., and tell it to her somethin' like this:

She looks of twenty-one, but she's under eighteen,
Now picture a man with a plan, what's he gonna do?
She's only sixteen, but looks twenty-two,
And age isn't a factor 'cause she's fine to the dude,
And plus she's built like a truck there must be somethin' in her food,
Or her water,
Because she's somebody's daughter
Who's attractive to a son, as well their father's,
And they know this, that ass sticks with us,
And like my homie told me once she's quite bootylicious,
Watch your mouth drop with them dubs that she threw on,
Dandy like candy, so you can get your chew on,
What'cha want to do? What'cha gonna do?
When you find out that she's far from twenty-two?
Yo it's not the same G, when you game G,
With the dames drop a line like this before you do

Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.

What's up with these bitches tryin' to play us like a fool?
Lookin' of age real proper, but just enrollin' in high school,
I'm callin' 'em collard greens 'cause they're corn bread fed,
Runnin' more game than what your homie Simon said,
Yo what is this, new statistic?
Went from pants and vaseline to short skirts and lipstick,
You ask who to blame? I don't know but I'ma,
Take it upon myself, and blame it on they Mama,
For beatin' that ass with a baseball bat,
Swole it all up now it's proper and fat,
Fed 'em attitudes, Big Macs, and milk,
Leave 'em all alone and it's on in the jilt,
Or the house, 'cause that's where they open up they mouth,
So in the day she's a child, at night she's an adult,
And Diggity Domino I like to ride it like a tractor,
But there's a question at hand because that age is a factor

Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.

There was a man named Bill, on a Saturday night he went to a club,
And read a sign before he entered it saying ""eighteen and up"",
But we know that's just a game for the man, that's runnin',
Thangs 'cause he's lettin' all the fly bitches come in,
Regardless of the age and shit,
But since this story's about Bill let's get back to it,
Bill met a collard green, she looks mean,
Ran a little game now she's on the team,
You know what comes next, took her to the snooty,
Treated her like a salad, tossed up the booty,
Bill played it wrong, and he got lazy,
No protection, guess what, oopsy daisy!
Now baby's pregnant,
'Cause Bill neglected,
To be protected,
Now he's arrested,
One year under eighteen and you're through,
So if you're game drop a line like this before you do:

Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me.

And nothing less, relieves stress

Cause you saw me poppin like Orvell Redenbacher
In case you need a notion, Hennessey's the potion
Hit the climax if you want the sex lotion

On these cool procedures bout gettin some some 
Putang, when it comes to ""P"" I'm a ""G"" and

Stuck it in a chick and had her flowin like an ocean

Wait... for me to give you a sex shower
And the good thing about it is it don't take an hour
For me to go from attention to at ease
Baby, try to take an easy on me please

But you can kill a man with the tip of your teeth
So not too slow and not too fast
And I like to see a sexy with a string in her ass
Now tell me, are you that chunk of the month?
Then maybe we can share a little Physical Funk

So now you know, Physical Funk is the Pump
And the bump which I like to stunts
And this is how I do it, back in the hood
Can't seem to go without nature's feel good
Cause homies like to feel that wet up and down
And ladies like to feel it deep round and round
And just to put this bomb ass track in context
Everybody with me if you like sex

Aún no puedes disimular, tu bipolaridad
Un día quieres y al otro día no sabes qué pensar 
A caso quieres algo más
Yo no lo puedo evitar 

Si pasaste por algo similar, levántate un trago 
Sonríele al aire como si hiciste algo malo 
Bebé como quiera contigo yo lo quiero hacer 
Este fronteo, para que pases por lo que pasé

Me dejaste con las ganas 
Y ahora tú como si nada 
Me dejas caer (y no me gusta pero se siente tan bien)

Dommin,"It all started with the chase
I was running in place
Always striving and straining
And never obtaining
What should have been mine
From the beginning and I'm
Always hoping to win you
To safely continue in

Love, trust
Crushed to dust
And I gave you all that I had
And I still lost

I dread the defeat
Fairytale incomplete
It's so tragic, depressing
Do you love me
I'm still guessing
I've grown tired of the dance
And the death of romance
I'm bleeding, I'm dying
And you're hardly trying

Love, trust
Crushed to dust
And I gave you everything that I had
And I still lost

Lets make believe that you want me
As much as I want you
Lets make believe",I Still Lost,2010
Dommin,"Are you ready to start the night
Do you feel alright, yeah do you feel alright
Hollow hunger, will you be bite
Have you the appetite, have you the appetite
I can mend your misery
If you believe in me
Do you believe in me
It's hard to swallow hard to perceive
But then it's plain to me
And it's plain to see that

Tonight, I'm coming home with you
(to fill the hole in you)
Tonight, it's only me and you
(What have you got to lose)

To a night you won't forget
But that you might regret
Yeah you might regret
Every action has a consequence

But do you know it yet, 
Do you know it yet
Nothing any vice can tame
It only feeds the flame
Will you feed the flame
Does it matter if you know my name
Because we're all the same
Maybe we're all the same

I will be gone

I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage

They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection

The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes

I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven never woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet

Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit, that's from

And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here

And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight)
It's all night (Don't go home tonight, chill)
It's all night (Please stay, don't go home tonight)

I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers
Like food for thought was my father but I ain't have the hunger
My self esteem was like me, tall and full of flaws
My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall

I can't fall in love with a bit of shit
Cause if I fall into it, it's being used and then quit
You more on the bitch, I'm on the analog sticks
You can quote me on my sentence nigga, catalog this
Odd Future wolves, ain't some acid artists
A bunch of massive artists, hang up, I had to call this
We mosh through streets like a pack of walrus
So when we come around them niggas had to ball fists
My swagger is natural flavor, then citric acid
Honey ginseng if it's extracted
And honey's with me if she's attractive
Her address, I address, my hoop in her basket

Man, when it came to school, I got bad grades
Now, when it came to the law, I didn't know how to behave
My nigga, my, my nigga but with music, music, music
I'm on the honor roll, honor roll, honor roll
With music, music, music
I'm on the honor roll, honor roll, we on a roll

Threw my condolences to bogus shit, cause I'm killing shit off
Survival on the love boat, I'm kicking every bitch off
Phone book flow, this some shit you'll never rip off
Shitting on you niggas, I'm a level past piss off
Risk all to get all, I'm all in

Give me a couple seconds, I'll be leaving with your girlfriend
Gotta get in fresh, got her mouth full, gargling

You ain't special though, give me neck and then I kick you out

Stacey Dash type, I'm cheating and they clueless

For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad hyenas in vagina's
I'm the fliest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blond Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga?
We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man?
You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero

Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yea
Doper than the 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps
Sorry bitch, I'm paper, chase
When I get where I am, I want my demands
With my nuts in my hand, like fuckin' bait

Yeah! Balls in my hand!

Kill them all! Yea",Lean,2012
Domo Genesis,"I fucked this flow

This is my electronic press kit, hot as some fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your currency
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitchs shit in my draws like you piss in my draws, nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drugs for when the champ come

Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creeping in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowling, hunger at it's fucking best
I'm a beast like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse the swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

The fortress is fortified (bitch)

I'm in the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

Knock-knock, who's there?
It's me, your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar)
Nigga don't believe me, kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebie jeebies?
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, ""Where my dick go?""
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her hole

Domo Genesis,"Look for me
Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world end, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking ""This is what I did it for""
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trife and Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs and that's
Prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'till my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans

Domo Genesis,"Guess with a few exceptions, yeah, I'm living honest
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college, started chasing profit
Sorry ma, I ain't forget about it but if money evil
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama and watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot, it's like I'm bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward, I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal, high-level, full throttle shit
Still searching for a reason why niggas ain't acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I hate the sway of things, I'm everyday cooling it
I'm getting blazed and laughing at the way they overdoing shit
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit, I'm truly too legit to quit

I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us
To every ho who hated, now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments and nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up
Black Cressida, pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us, riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles,
Kenny rolling blunts, got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit, ironic cause the audios
As nautical as ships, look momma, look momma
Look, your product is legit, I promise, honest
Karma got me balling up my fist
'Til I demolish your clique, pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets, regardless of who talking
I'm farming, harvesting hits
Just me and Domo and lit marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up

We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch
I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' Ollie switch
Buncha novices, odd future the squad, its thick

In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather
Sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists, it's cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy posers looking silly boy
I'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (diddy riese)
Na'kel smith transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens
See y'all niggas trippin' man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Over and over, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)
I'm seeing it's a drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs

Domo Genesis,"Ayo, hoes holler hallelujah, how I maneuver
Passenger's side with Ruger, kinda sewer
My mind is a sewer, infested with garbage
Crime, rhyming and music, disrespecting the market
Like a Mexican martyr, boy, I do it to death
Nothing left with the carcass, squeeze a Tec on the target
Aim the wreck at your artist, flames, a mess on the carpet
Then hit everything except for the daughter
Cat burglar to a merciful murderer
Certainly not with the circus, they trying serve
I'm either too hood for my own good
Or I'm too good for my own hood
Cold is the climate in the hearse
Where they found me in the dirt, too demonic for the church
I body any and everybody until the day they put my body in the earth
This is ghetto gossip while I work

Live from Venice, the something menace
Put me in the Guinness for raising hell up for all the sinners
High as tinters, violinists, I string them all along
Tied to the flow like water skis in the red ocean
Hang like an apostrophe, any MC no Qu'ran
I prayed to the God, then prayed on their bodies all at once
Sun setting, never regretting the day's events are gone
Forgive me for my sins, with everything that I ?
Sweaty, sick as spaghetti, my noodle machete sharp
To niggas that wanna spark, I pray for you, hallelujah
Quick as a cougar when I maneuver
You spit maneuver, eating Peruvian in my rishwa pen
Pretty Julia Robinson, I'm a woman robbing you
Of your coolness, part of the reach like the stewardess
Underground like the sewage is, who fucking with the kid?
Did this show evidence?
International, such an animal, yeah I really been
Killing on the daily, you niggas crazy and asterisk
Star, follow me you could probably find the main jar
I been major, it's Rapsody, boy

I don't trust the score, I've been baffled by judges' cards before
Never leave it in their hands, that's the art of war
I learned the proper punching power started from the floor
Ground up, renovate, a wall is just another door
Resurrected like the phoenix, blazing every stage
Spread my wings and fly, but gravity's a heavy cage
Hellfire and heaven's rage on every page
Revelation propaganda, maybe it's the seven plagues
Aiming at the tower, same commercial, different station
They stuck on training wheels and tracing paper, vapor chasing
I'm half amazing, a quarter sinner, a quarter savior
Fascinated, Rakaa seen the wretched paint the righteous painting
My travel agent's favorite, preacher's son, no sign of fading
The lights weaponized, fireworks at night displaying
The blazing arrows fly, a thousand points of light just raining
Careful when you're in the quarters, chariots are hydroplaning

Fucker, we from the hundreds now
Kill a fuck assumption, we bucking off or we ducking down
Couple blocks away from the form, check how we run this town
You fuckers get this work in this bun, check my circumference now
Circle wasn't set stretching, yoga flame
Hottest rapper in the streets and they don't even know his name
Kept the dope, boy, and I ain't even need a golden chain
I'm focused, man, you shooting like a rookie that don't know his range
Smoking, watch me go insane, opus and the Novocaine
Shit was once an open game, we got it by a rope and chain
Losing all control of wild paintings in my broken brain
I don't think you get it, scrap me down for anything you niggas sending at me
Young niggas flexing, mean mugs but trigger happy
I'm getting high, I don't ever let a minute pass me
I'm feeling famished, bitch, I'm sick of fasting
About that action, we can get it cracking
Never find shit to match

I caught a body, they called it a verse
Called the cops, I caught the life, they calling a hearse
Pain is easy in reverse, I think pleasure hurts
The first rule is win, the second's don't forget the first
I think the worst now behind us
Hello first-timers, it's welcome to one-liners
Question anything against the center of alignment
This rock ain't a diamond until it's polished up and shining
Decide to ride the retro minutes to the summit's peak
Others fall trying to climb it because their stomach weak
When we climbing in the summer heat
They throwing shade against the team when the others meet
Despite the ?
After this drops, nothing’s best kept but nothing’s secret
If nothing’s nothing, then what the fuck is getting even?
Just an odd man out, another duck in season
What’s yours is yours, what’s mines is mines
It seems as simple as it simply rhymes
I keep the simpleton spit in all the sympathy lines
I mean it’s Craig G rap came on symphony shines

Slay the Nazarene, you just fire water, I’m gasoline
It ain't A day in Philly if I don't pass a fiend
It’s blood everywhere, similar assassins seem
Purify the water, correlate the tour to a maccabee
You think that you could box a Vinnie? 
Dummy, that’s obscene
The nine milli, silly, dummy, but the mac is mean
The downstairs wild pretty, but the attic clean
You have unbearable lightness and just a lack of being
You ain’t built to shoot the fire with me, that’s the thing
I’m only after one thing, money, that’s the rings
I’m only after one head, money, that’s the king’s
A rack on a bigger rack and so he have to sing
I got an Ingraham Mac Eleven and it has a beam
And that’s a beautiful love there, it has a gleam
You wasn’t in a platoon, cousin, cause that was Shane
Old school, still loaded the guns with Vaseline

Selling the J dirty boogie, gray hoodie, hit the dougie
Pinky rings on racks of chicken nuggets
Shit’s like shooting fish in a bucket, damn the hummus
I’m in Japan for the summer, land the plane
Or Jamaica, black rain in the forecast
Four-four class, open a stolen Accord door and haul ass
Body disposed by Albanian doorman for four grand, aw man
I throw the lamb in the ground and leave it overnight
You ain’t ever seen this in your life
You ain’t used to being where I been to, Curly and my men do
You ain’t been through shit I been through
This is limited edition, 666 driven
Tryin'a keep from out of prison
So I lay low, throwing dice, tomato sauce for the boss
Place the crib over the cross, it’s us",Hallelujah [*],2014

I give a fuck who's who
I chef the same when I'm preparing it
From bad kid to semi-rich middle-aged American
Rooted in my heritage, wounded for the derelicts
The root of every evil is the truth of all appearances
I crack the sound but the beat is still a barrier
And every fucking inch of every street around this area
The Venice carry us up like dough rises
Rap transit all city, no license
The city is beneath, I watch it from a bird's eye
Brain dead, two left, they shot me in my third eye
Shot out my eye like ? on a Christmas day
Reach for pistols as I watch the fuckin' Pistons play
I set the tone with the writings on the wall
The city cleans it up like we inviting 'em all
Evolution's all messed up now, chop the middleman
Stab the messenger, not the literal
I ran without a cause and was the best before I knew shit
Before I took a cruise ship, before I been to Houston
I ain't tying up loose ends I let 'em waiver
Pulling out these lavers and pounding out the pavement
Gone

I'm the lyrical gangsta

I be a young motherfucker of the rap camp
Style symbolizes my nastiness like a tramp stamp
Wamp wamp, where it's at
Fear fact, just let them legends die and I'll inherit that
I'm fit for the carry, weight of the world I carry on my back
With a fairer sack, inquisitions to the mirror
Exactly what niggas fearing, see the future in it's clearest
It is I, Doms, dropping lyrical pipe bombs
Until an icon, I choke your life like a python
I'm who the children look up, probably got 'em doing kush ups
Super high, call me Superfly, bitch I'm Jimmy Snuka
Got you feeling like you took a hit of heroin
And that's for veterans, the way I bury 'em, embarrassing
You know better than puttin' that fire near the kerosine
I said don't make me tell again like kids with speech impediments
They can't see where my head is, I'm ahead
Roll the credits, roll the medics
Getting high till I feel I'm copacetic

I'm the lyrical gangsta

Yo I've been trying to keep it silent, my tendency to violence
The suit and tie be fading, the truth about the shining
The sliding through the masses, smiling eyes through glasses
My style been altercated all the while to pile my cash in
But fuck that though, I want a ho that stay up late
My dirty bottom bitch to fuck with me until the wake
Mad illegal C.R.E.A.M, ain't no rules, that's the dream
In regal swimming pools prepping tools for future schemes
Laying low and creeping it, selling dope and sleeping it
Wrap the dough up in a rope, keep in what I'm sleeping in
Mattress fettucini, life's a flick and I'm Fellini
Pinky diamond rings above the rims of ice martinis
Trees throughout the day, hour focused in a haze
We living life the most, been comatosed all the way

Come alive like heart rates, followed by a car chase
Chris Rock selfies with a top 5 arms race
Moncler skullies pulled over like cover ups
On the up and up, all the bottoms all Balmain
So even a robbery is expensive
Fly guy etiquette, my niggas get extensive
Abide by peddle, a homage from off the benches
And find mine buried in solemnly by the trenches
Bed-Stuy's version of Nas, no mirage
Freeze y'all on speed dials, the murder squads
From where the arms echo like they hear the falsetto
While I'm in here with a Mimi, forreal'll hold a rod
That's like 3 lines in one couplet
So that's 312 like I'm callin' Cabrini

On top of the world

Closet full of kicks, the lot is full of whips
Sippin' nothin' but the finest bottles of the Myx
Tryna see it all 'fore I lie up in a ditch
No takin' it with me, fuck depositing my chips
They bite a nigga's dick
Cause when I get bored I take a model for a trip
But go dine up in the Ritz
Why would I hide it if I'm rich? I'ma show off
Forreal, why you think Statik signed me to the clique?
Fuck you, pay me, least I said it to 'em nicely
Hate me, I reflect 'em, sendin' miss precisely
We put them grands in Jacksons to the safe
Cause of Washingtons, we spendin' them with wifey
Remember that? Thought you seen the end of that
But we carry tradition, what would be the sense in that?
Take though from Ea$y, might as well send it back
Got goons everywhere, where you gon' spend it at?
I'm done with the scramblin', pack handlin'
Shook the Ds like big titty bitch dancin'
If I get my chance in, I'm advancin'

Said I'm just tryna fill the trophy room

This is beautiful, ain't it?
All these feelings of nostalgia ain't new to you, ain't it?
I did this shit already, my niggas, viewing is tainted
But watch I still kill it all through whatever arrangements
Got a shot, long range, Danny Ainge 'em
I can't blame 'em, I transport the message like Jason Statham
Sleep is minimal, perspiration, elevated
Rippin' shit easy like perforation
Soon they gon' hold for investigation
More soul than your grandma cookin'
I wonder, got 'em hooked like I know what you did
Last summer, it's a bummer tryna step to me
Bein' black right now, stressin' me
I'll shoot the sheriff and the deputy
Smokin' mad weed so this shit do not get the best of me
Stirrin' up your mental currents, word, I got the recipe
Herbs, you just speakin', man, I'm more show and prove
No jewelry, stack my gold in my trophy room

On top of the world
It's funny how things change
When you came from nothin'
Now the world knows your name

I get overjoyed with emotion
But I feel empowered
Because, I tell you
When I first looked into his eyes
I knew he would be something special
He was so bright and so funny at the same time
I said there would be a day
When I would share him with the world
I just didn't know when
And that day has come, it's now
And I couldn't be more happy for him
I'm so proud
He's something special and I'm glad
He's getting a chance to show you what he is
Because I saw it a long time ago
I got you, no matter what
I'm there for you
And, um no matter what obstacles come your way
Always remember that you are gonna be you
And no one else can take that away from you
Remember that the stars and the sky is the limit
And once you reach those, you keep going
Just keep going and never look back
Because it belongs to you, it's your time
And I would always say that to you
Just always reach for the stars
So, I want you to know that I'm always gonna be
The wind underneath your wings
I'm gonna be the water underneath your bridge
I'm gonna be the bullet in your Glock
If you know what I mean
That means that I just got you, no matter what

Give him a glimpse of who they love the most
I'm blunted, whoever they wanted, I ain't running over nothing
The blood that my heart is pumping is one below
We play this game, no one has repercussions
Took some losses, see where I faltered
And learned some lessons from it
My momma say I must be blessed or something
The same gift that got me paper, I be stressing from it
Remember jumping in cribs, thinking what drawn in rims
It wasn't all BT but this is just how I live
See, Imma take all of mines, if they got nothing to give
'Cause lack of inspiration had me chasing broken ideas
See, I was aggravated, blind pacing my mind unaware
That being lost would be the place I would find my ideas
I was a shoe fit, lucrative, new little nigga
I been through the blues groove
What couldn't you do to a nigga?
From what we had, this looks beautiful, nigga
If we had the end of day, I'd ask Krit to save room for a nigga
My life story gotta be worth somebody's time
This much weed, I need to breathe
Keeping my lungs on the line
Don't kill the vibe, I just begun to unwind
If they won't let me free my mind, then fuck it

This hustle, only thing I knew from the start
All alone, singing this song in my heart

I feel like so apart, just trying to stay a part of this league

I see why my grandfather drinking, that Seagram's
'Cause life ain't easy, remember momma had to scream it
And caught two busters to take her son
To get the teachers, then hopped on another to graduate
There's some seeing some
House, still working job, fortunate we eating
So telling me I can't? Fuck him, I can't believe it
'Cause I never thought a million years
Would bring us to this region
Lost a couple, want to rob but my focus still on the leading
Never caught me finding me, what distances me from the team, shit
And no matter what we've grow through, I love you dudes
I mean it
Smoking on that green, cause the path ain't always scenic
Learn from where I lack at, cause nobody's a genius
It's just some shit you gotta say, I'll break your heart in pieces
Trying to bottle it, call my own path, I don't follow shit
So far to go and feeling out of it
If this what comes from being lost, then I'm proud of it

Don & Dewey,"Woo, the joint was a jumpin' on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac
And out stepped a cat named Pete

Diamonds on a every finger
Wore the tailor made suit
He smoked a black cigar
He wore a stetson hat, he wore a pair of cowboy boots

He busted on through the doorway
Bad as a he can be
Pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'my name is a big boy Pete'

The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
Over in a corner stood a bad man Brown
Brown smiled and grinned, he said
My friend, come three steps farther and I'll a do you in

Now, Pete, said, a look a here, buddy
Before I tan your hide
I got a forty five that keeps me alive
And seven bullets on my side

Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter, right a, out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown, cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth

Brown slipped around behind boy Pete
Cut him from his head, right on down to his feet
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
Pete took his stetson hat an beat the scene

Now, if you ever down on the corner
Down on a honky tonk street
Don't mess with Brown, he'll cut you down
Take a lesson from a big boy Pete, wow

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Don Airey,"You tell me what you're never gonna be
And I'll show you what you just can't see
If you want good living gotta grab it with your hands
If you don't, then don't bother making no plans

Free being what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

You won't get nothing if you got no wheels
If you got no wheels you'll never know how it feels
There's no reason for the things you said
Don't get moving you'll pretty soon be dead, dead and forgotten

Free living the life of a king
You can't have everything

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

Everybody fighting for a living in the street
One step back and you're out of the heat
There's just one thing when you set yourself free
You have a good time boy but watch out for me

Free being what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

Past midnight I still see the land

The woman's flames are reachin' higher
We were fools - we called her a liar
All I hear is - Burn
They didn't believe she was devil's sperm
She said ""Curse you all never learn when I leave, there's no return""
The people laughed 'till she said - ""Burn""

Earth was shakin' - we stood and stared
When it came, no one was spared

Don Albert,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

you'll still a kiss and then
If she should say Manana

you're gonna meet again

Flying away to my little bunch of happiness
Oh, how I pine for those lips sweet as wine
They'll be pressed close to mine some sunny day

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Don Baker Trio,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now

Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

So much to say not just today but always

Oh, and more, much more than this

Regrets, I've had a few

But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Don Braden,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1995
Don Braden,"You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 
I feel like this is the beginning

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

Love has joined us
Love has joined us
Let's think sweet love",You Are the Sunshine of My Life,1995
Don Braden,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1995
Don Braden,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you",Moonglow,1995
