Face down, ass up, I'ma make her love me
Probably don't love me but let her suck and fuck me
Gucci wanna sex ya, tell me is it itched ya
Probably could a hit it dawg, I ain't even hit it yet

Friends? Tell' em all to come, we gon' have some mo' fun
Yeaaaah
Chew on me like some bubblegum
I'll lick you like a lollipop

You know pain is pleasure
Can you make me shed a tear?
Smack my ass, grab my neck

Just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey
And he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shoppin' sprees
He wanna buy me Gucci

And if you can make it rain, then Ludacris can make it thunder
I ain't messin' with these lames but it seem I make them wonder
How I came and took the game for the past seven summers
Now yo' woman wanna get it from the front (from the front)
from the back (from the back)
And if she with it, I'ma hit it from the side
Give her what she want (she want), in the lack (in the lack) 
She a freak gurl and I can see it in her eyes
She can go tit (go tit), for tat (for tat)
it's so good that I made her wanna cry
A little bit of this (little bit of this)
little that for two piece biscuit and sum fries
Straight from churches, ya boyfriends' worthless
Cause Luda' go deep while he barely scratch the surface
She itching for a scratch like she DJ JC
If u looking fo' ya match, bitch come and find me
I be in the A town, I ain't that hard to find
Put ya legs up in the air and see the DTP sign
If ya wanna meet my mama, that's a thing I won't do
You say muthafuck me, nah muthafuck you, kno' why

[Verse 1]
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til your bitch came in
Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin' this Buffie The Body
Ain't your name 'lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin'
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin'
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes 
And a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and request that I'm da man
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubberbands

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Shawty tellin' me she ain't neva suck no dick
Neva took a pill or neva ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee
When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans-Jordache Jeans
I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
I'm a the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves that's three
Ain't no waffle house baby hell I can't eat
Gucci hood like your hoodman hes so extreme
Wearin' doces in the club cause you kno the boy geeked
Top the top on that thang let you see my seats
We've been rollin' rollin' rollin' we ain't slept in weeks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gucci Mane the fly nigga get your mind right
Or a cries by the twelve like a case of budlight
Sell a cush by a bell so you kno might shit tight
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight
I'm high like Fabo hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pillz that's at least bout 40
I'll pour dem in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pillz call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pillz man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Chorus]

Ay wassup Gucci Mane
Why you sweatin' so hard? Is you rollin' or somethin'
Shit well baby I might be
But got damn what is you doin' 
You jockin' a playa. You ch-Chewy ova here right
Look I ain't
(K-Reilly) 
K-Rab baby You know what I mean I'm not a piece of Bubblegum
What I'm doin is not your business
But matta of fact while you ova here is you a waitress or somethin? 
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress
So do what you do aight
I'm a give you this hundred dollars
Go get you what ever you drankin'
Bring me and click about ten of dem orange juices, 
Five crunk juices nd we'll be straight how bout that
And is you straight is you single or is you marry

Gucci Mane,"Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt  
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys? 
They only talk to her, because, 
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? 
I mean, her butt, is just so big 
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha 
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me 
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin' 
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, 
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
To do with my selection 
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six  
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Today we gonna be making crack>
Take 36 ounces of coke
With water in a pot on the stove
Step to make them boulders add
If the flame is low then turn it up whoa!
Just wait
Then bag it up
You got the key homie
That's the recipe

[E-40]
Before you decide to elect yourself in the game of dope
Better know that it is cut throat
Cant be cracking under pressure when your backed in a corner
Against the ropes
They ain't calling it snitching no more
They calling it telling the truth
They say you better get down first before they decide to get down on you
Mixing it up
Shake and bake
Its 2008, they got more data than '88
We used to make crazy cake, crazy cake
Flipping weight, flipping weight
Got get in and out before it be too late
I don't want to be 6 feet under
So I pack and tote my thump
Suckers want to hate and block my thunder
Cause I got more kicks than a punter
Murder rates go up in the summer
Killers go hunting like a hunter
You can live good for 6 years
Then it's football numbers

Dread head killers with me before deh dem up insulate

Stiff a liffy pisso nigga come and comprehend from me
Talk slick to me, E40 style, you hearing me?
Got a green skirt and I bought it off a recipe
Hella p's, hella keys, yellow, purple, red'ly

Guarantee to add a few layers of bling on your stitching
Being teeded in your chest get you stinging and itching
Got to have the right ingredients before you can start
Like 1 part gangsterism 1 part heart
2 parts of keeping it G and add you 100 milligrams of a killer man and you'd had done it
Put it all inside a Cadillac with them 3's and them 4's
Swing wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues

Now you done made you a trill nigga

Stoppable I jump over obstacles
Stop my grind like stop sunshine
So improbable probable mission impossible
I said it two times nigga, nigga stop lying
Bullshit you sellin' now I'm just not buying
Flow so nice but the kid's not kind
Swear its sicker than a new flu they got called swine
Standing on point like a unicorn
Strapped with a uni-bomb
Every day's a workday but don't wear uniform
Gucci mane a dubadun
Trouble like a Capricorn
Trapper month goin' on a money makin' marathon
You the jocker I be robin
And the riddle is the Batman's throne
Try not to fuck my money up and rap career like Pacman Jones
Thumb print me, finger print me
But can we agree to disagree
I'm from east Atlanta 6 where the boys dump bricks
But we don't bump the blueprint 3
Wanna box me jus' like Max B
But you cant fuck me like resh p
Like Ali I'm a float like a butterfly sting like a bee cause its big Gucci,

But God didn't fail me

D.A nailed me, watch them jail me
Take it like a champ while the whole world mail me
Young don't like me, jay outsells me
Nothing in the world Kanye couldn't tell me
You can beat anyone but Gucci
Jaw so hard I can hardly do me
Cause whatever that I heard use to let that
Bet if you had the chance to you'd mute me
Convicted felon my lil' friends jailin'
My stash here you go and my bones done swellin'
Crazy so I need Prozac really
My home kept skep n' my folks so eary
So hard workin' that my bones still weary
Fall in the club then the hoes start cheerin'
So hear me, hear me, I know y'all hear me
I don't like life to much not really
High like Britney, stoned like Jimmy
Got a second chance like Vick in Philly
This ain't snap music, this is trap music

Hotta' den tha' hottest summa',
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Domer,
Dope color Shanay O Conner?,
Should I name another woman,
Russian like president Obama,
Wanna buy two extra commas,
All my shoes are Fara Gomma?
Lightning actually hittin' thunda',
Even Stevie Wonder wonder,
Why yo girl get home on time so much I had to change my numba',
Sarcasm, these bitches need to ride 'em while I pass 'em,
I wouldn't even give that bitch a orgasm,
Miraculously my niggas stand beside, not in back of me,
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity,
The compact to capacity I cash out automatically,
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality.

I got the green, drank, pills, blow,
Runnin' round the town gettin' money I suppose,
I'm the gingerbread man

Trap house bunkin' up all night, take flight,
Droppin' 10 bases? its jumpin' that white?
Trees to that paper so I'm something like a kite,
Loud stanky kush and it tellin' me to light,
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin' like a light,
Rolli'n stay money and my pockets just glide,
Everyday diamonds cause they don't like to hide,
V-V-S light yea so you block yo eyes,
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie,
Hit ya color diamonds and get ratchet like a fly?
The brick man, the bread man I don't tell no lies.

Money Mane gettin' it in, I'm only in it to win
I ain't come to say I'm the champ, I get bored and do it again
If I ev'red across a tranny, I ain't asked her for a twin
cause its number time, done came to gather up all my inns
it's fifteen minutes to ten, eighth in and I'm drinkin' gin
I could act like we were fiends, but I dont like to pretend 
I got 30 stacks new Ajax, it's the future price of my air max
I'm addicted to abllin' I hear Lennox Mall and I relapse
Your slimfast, little bankroll, my stash getting way to fat
No push-up, just cook-ups, I'm booked up, I don't wanna lapse
There's Money Mane, and Juice Mane, and Gucci Mane and ol' Brickman
I got juice all in my kitchen so my house smell like cocaine

And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died
And that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I make history
So I don't turn around no more
I look at whats in front of me
I'm focused on the future cause yesterday is history

Guess yo mom didn't teach ya that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet ya at
But let me check my schedule
I'm free Tuesday 3 weeks from now
You bring your crew I bring my crew
Just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stomping ground
But I guess you know that by now
But everywhere you go you hear me
That's why your upset right now
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb
But I'm in my vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber
Bank account are pregnant now
The day they tried to murder me a day I cant forget about
And I don't wish no death on homie
Just want him to hear me out

Me don't spit the perfect verses

I admit my words can hurt
I dissed tiny she didn't deserve it
Our song I didn't interpret it right and I'm sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged
Told me face the game with courage
Clay me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me Jeezy and T.I. share one thing in common all are poets
Role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
And y'all gon owe respect to me and I don't like apologies
Just diss me till you satisfied
I swear it doesn't bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets
Wont reflect off me but words and insults only show the world how y'all respectin' me

Half my friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
Things I got I know they want it
Things I done they haven't done it
Tho' they say that they my friends
I know that these niggas opponent
We can joke and laugh and party
But I know their smiles are phony
But I still pray that the Lord give 'em all the things they wanted
All the money in the world cant get the joy I'm felling homie
Like the third date with a woman like you and not for your money
You can help someone and love someone but still they turn and burn you so hard
Want you and revenge watch out cos so called friends
And MJG said it best man will I ever know who my friends
Through thick and thin cos so called friends will turn to foes.

I'm my best friend
And I'm my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them
Is you feelin' me
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died
And that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I make history
So I don't turn around no more
I look at whats in front of me
I'm focused on the future cause yesterday is history",Worst Enemy,2009

Yes I break 'em down and I sell 'em whole
Try me, watch your whole crew fall like some dominoes

Riding with them bricks got me feeling real cautious

Two swisha, three swisha, four swisha, five
So turn my music up and tell these hoes to get live
Got a pocket full of hundreds and some bottles on ice, ice
Conjure and lime got a nigga feeling nice, nice
Dessert on my hip so if you gamble roll the dice
When I let it off once, make a nigga think twice, twice
You got more dough then homie you gon have to show me
You never say it rains like Tony Toni Tone
My Chevy's outside and it's sitting on Kobe's
And I keep the hood with me like Obi Wan Kenobe
Wood grain trim, seats softer than your butt butt
Make the car rattle from the speakers in my trunk, trunk
Swishas burning slow and it got a nigga stuck, stuck
But don't be a fool cause the tool's on tuck tuck

Tell that slow bitch to bring another round
We gon' party til the suns up
Ladies rub your titties and gangsta's put your guns up
Money, money, money if you got it throw your ones up
And if they ain't got it tell 'em shut up you dumb fuck
My money stays in hand you could say I got a grip, grip
Out to scoop my chips you could say I got a dip, dip
Cause I talk money while these haters talk shit, shit
And if they keep on talking I'ma empty out a clip, clip
But I don't want no problems I'm just trying to get my game on
Take a couple shots and use the alcohol to blame on
Holla at some chicks then find a bitch to put my name on
Then I'ma be I'ma be the one she put that thang on
I got the perfect song to make you want me want to shake, shake
Take her to the crib I don't take her on no date, date
We all up in the club til the glass and table break, break
And all they wanna know is how much more that I can take, take

[Chorus]

Now keep the camera's flashin' we about to shoot a movie
A thick chick let me sip my glass on her booty
She stuck upon my hip and she swear she ain't no groupie
While I'm stuck up on the VIP, but everything is all Gucci
So I gathered all the women and we about to take a shot, shot
Gone out my mind, who's there nigga knock knock,
Don't you hear that 808 beatin' down your block, block
Keep the party going cause the party don't stop, stop

All up in the middle with the business unofficial
When I can't stand a chick tryna score my fun
Looking for a dude to rip you off some ?
I don't need a chick tryna throw my one's
Let me look rich, I wanna have his son
I sip Perignon but do I look dumb
Get a job shawty turn my knob
And if it don't open up make sure you slob

Be dangerous like Michael

Don't test me cos I keep a clipper number two pistols

Boy, stop, Sir Luscious Left Foot's on fire
Tryna block my shine just ain't gon' happen, so don't try
Every time I get on this microphone I like to spit
Inking hit up after hit, this penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic, now they riding dicks
Like styling on these suckas out here tryna buy their bitch
Now they rich, try convince everybody to trick off
But a true boss done paid the cost, she giving away them drawers
Word to the brown James, he some chicken chow mein
Really mane, you done say some silly things
And the fella Dana Dane, boy, you cuffed, claimed a dame
Hey, my main thang got my last name, know what I mean?

I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Hold up, hold up, guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it

They put Gucci in a cell then Madea went to jail
I make music, I make movies, I need Tyler Perry sales
Loud smell coming out the Lamb', fuck it, what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Guccied down, she got on Chanel
In the cut rolling stupid kush like I'm in a rush
In the club with a half a pound, 150 blunts
Zone 6, East Atlanta's own, fuck with Nia Long
So I shine like it's showtime, all my jewelry on
On the block with my stupid watch, boy, you need to stop
When I stop, everybody watch, car don't have a top
In a stretch, cost a stupid check, roll another pack
And I'm gone, I can't even flick, Eastside, where you at? Gucci

Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it

Can't be trippin' 'bout no paper 'cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol grip in my lap at all times in the 'lac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can't a nigga stop that
Not when God's got his hands on me, only the strong survive
And the weak-minded are falling by the wayside, they try
But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
With success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, it's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled 'cause there might not be tomorrow

Color cut clarity

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch, I'm M.C. Hammer, I'm about cream
I got thirty cars, whole lot of dancers
I take 'em everywhere, I'm M.C. Hammer
Started selling though, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick

I'm at the car lot, I'm going broke
I pay for five, they front a couple more
I take 'em home like I do my hos
I dress 'em up, I buy 'em clothes
Glass slippers, I gas hos
Now she's acting brand new on you assholes
Limousines, I did that
Two-door coupes, boy I live that
My top back, I'm circumcised
I pull it back just to go inside
She thinking 'folic, I'm thinking wings stop
Feigning lemon pepper, I got my thing cocked
Black bat-mobile, it's only new Ferrari
It's called Scaglietti, one button like an Atari
I'm just advising, my profit's rising
Niggas buying stocks in a nigga like I'm Verizon

I got the Porsche, I was so ecstatic
Hundred grand a day, my operation is so elaborate
Credit card scams, that was for the fagots
Mother fuck window shopping, boy I gotta have it
Now my shit be booming all across the atlas
Gucci puchi money long, now we call him Alex
Had to move from Dade because that shit was local
Pick up the mansion and I sat that bitch back down in Boca
My baddest bitch is Latin, but they call me loco
Till I fuck 'em in they ass out in Acapulco
I'm thinkin' money, every moment thinkin' money
I bust a nut, then I'm back to thinkin' money
My wrist froze, my mind blow, I'm off slow, my eyes closed
You gotta judge a man by his principles
Teflon Don, I am invincible

Seventy grand make my jeans sag like some hammer pants

It's Gucci Mane, yeah, that's my name,
I'm goin' thug, I'm goin' thug
Blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
I'm like M.C. Hammer, I put that on my grandma
I ride through East Atlanta in my new Ferrari
It's up for fifty-eight if you don't have one, sorry
I let you borrow mine, I think I'm M.C. Hammer
I never borrow jewelry, I'm takin' naked dancers
It's an occasion, a celebration at Central Station
With Haitian hos and Jamaicans I'm tryin' to make it
Old school, want to race it, we can test it
I'm flexin', I leave a sucka egged-up for breakfast
Throwin' spit, throwin' up respect, and I'm well-connected
I'm M.C. Hammer, hundred-fifty on the kitchen, it's Gucci

I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean

Please man call Obama I wanna buy the dollar sign
Just like first day of school my swag killed em like Colombine
The dollar signs my logo and gucci's my clothing line
Put on that purple label polo and them hoes say damn he fine
Should be able to keep her so I keep her
Feed her treat her like a diva
My fetish in Costa Rica 'cause she know that I'm a cheater
What up the cost of living
I feel like a trillion bucks
Got beef with a million fuck niggas I don't give a fuck
On south beach where my house is
Any where on earth my turf but I'm so down south alligator couches
A public service announcement
Gucci so fucking paid pay 2 stacks just for a fade
Bitches surfing on my waves

By the bar and I own the club
Can't own the bar 'cause I'm superstar

I'm so turned up cant turn me down
Blowing pounds that's higher than jupiter
I'm hot turning up Lucifer
At club crucial in a stoopid car
Every verse my flow gets stupider
My producer don't want to produce for ya
My bank account on steroids
My stash ain't got no room for it
New drop head paid cash for it
Ferrari 220 on the dashboard
Long rich nigga wait here his crash course
I pull up to the club in a fast porche
When I leave all the hoes give a sad voice
Got bills to pay and things to do
New hoes to screw and business moves
I'mma business man whats the business plan
Used to rip it in the band for the extra grand
I'm successful man hell yes I am
Dead fresh I am bought an extra lamb
And I don't never ask how much it cost
That's silly 'cause I don't really give a damn

Streets taught me everything I train to sell
Did wrong so long know didn't know nothin' else
Then my lima crew was like me a member
Think every man worth, enemies himself
Glad as well but I'm mad as hell
Cause my best friend probably gon' die in jail
I ain't no lie to tell prolly cry like hell
If I dwell on it 'cause he got a eighty years
I'm going hard see I might as well
Guess I gotta a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy dad my great great great great
Grandpa had a really crazy swag
So I stand a day
Diggin' down a grave

I done rushed and killed ain't proud of that
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches
I'm a solider I understand where the cowards at
My home boy gone where the flowers at
Out of money and the work can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish momma there
Could come down now and see me rap
But she see me now and I believe in that
Wanna script of that, I ain't going back 
So I put my family on I my back
Lost so much I cant pay that back

Hurry up hurry up Gucci on the news
They said he walked out the chair rocking stupid jewels
They tried to find what it do they made that Jew confused
Too much cash on my hundred falling out my troops
A yellow wrist bright as piss bitch I'm the shit
Big Gucci called swizz lets make a hit
Two things in this world I ain't never seen
Are you a foreigner nigga I need to help to get me mean?
I hope you suffocate me totally baby let me breath
Cause I don't chase nothing but paper bitches chasing me
Excuse my french I'm Gucci I'm so fucking gutter
It don't make no sense to switch for none of these motherfuckers

My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown
When I hit the club everything goes
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here I don't really care
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?
Yea that's the way you love me huh?

So not to say my life is it
I said no doc my wife is it
Now I'm back back going like I never never left
Plus the boy right here I'm fresh to death (whoo)
Chris Jones on my feet see I can't fall from Suzuki jeeps
Now I'm jumping off decks
The word about the haters they can be upset and
The black card in my back pocket
The corner sig' is looking like a speeding rocket
Yeah I'm zooming on a highway
And you should love me I did it my way

My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown

Want to ball with me baby what it do, party animal
Shes a man-eater baby, that's the kind of party animal
I'mma party animal, shes a party animal

I'm a party animal, used to be a trafficker
Bricks up on the bus call me the roll manager
200,000 cash I might put that in the challenger
To only ride on more man cause that's my eat Atlanta car

We'll never have a fist fight
But last night we had a sex fight
Then told her have blessed night
I'm leaning I'm meanin'
I fall asleep might have dreams in it
Did the club thing, brought my team in it
Last night I bring my queen in it
I go get it you bullshitter's
I hit it, damn right the kid did it
You hood critters and hood chickens
Please stay out my business

Two bad streets off the main road
You had her but she left so 
That's just the way the game go
No one on my level 
So please get up out on my lane holmes
I met a girl so real no need to bring no game home
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song
I'm on her like a long john 
Short skirt with no thongs on
Sexy naked sunbathing outside my house with frames on
I took her from some busters? 
And that boy ain't gon' shit bout it
Its alright we can tell that sucka to forget about it

Ladies to my left
The weathers so hot 
Snows on my chest

Tried to get her number

Remember back rubs and pink champagne

Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left its like my heart died

Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said how you don't you trust me you did a homicide
Then said I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came at
Baby girl so bad, dis me but I ain't mad
Now you wanna tease me
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me

I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me out cause she cant buy cheap shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch

I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit

Remember 2000 you was acting all boozie
9 years later and you're best friend choosie (muah)
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies (yeah)
Damn

Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want
That's when she fantasized that I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride

Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20

Your girlfriend say's my ear rings are erotic 
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic it's Gucci

Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes
Monkey nigga's in my hood I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too 
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (Gucci)

Drop beam 
Off set things color ice cream 
White dreams 
She can fuck me that's a pipe dream 
S-O poppin' x-pills so exciting 
My ex chick n ex homeboy uninvited 
Cases of ace of spade bitch getcha wasted 
The waitress I made her reloaded like the matrix 
I lean laid with a bad bitch black n' Asian
On 20 headed to buckhead I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelery off that shit is fugasey
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken 
Real n you nigga's really really good at faken 
So trill I'm a keep it real I'm back to the basics

Heads up
My partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key 
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' jukebox
Pop-pop hear the glock cock 
And I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D 
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic in shank 
That shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya
I cut ya til the white meat 
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat 
I smoke the best I get my dro' from California
Get high n go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a doner 
I roam the streets so who the fuck is YOU

But I'm a beat it up

He can lay you down
But I'm a beat it up

I hopped up out my bed
Got my swag on
Stronger than fillet Mignon
Two Gs blown just for cologne
Money never limited
So Icey with benefits
My driver needs a passport
All my cars are immigrants!
It's so sickening
History you're witnessing
I had a girl she quit me
Now I'm single want to get with me?
Sticky again they stick to me
If you see your chick with GUCCI
Think before you confronting ruley
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'
430 stepped on purp it
08 verty rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean as this detergent
Got your girlfriend picking purses
Say she lonely
Gucci only one with to meet me in person
When she met me home
My bitch told me that shes over first

It's 4 in the mornin'

You at home
And she with me
So morning it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it
Beatin' her down
Straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets
Got your blanket at the laundromat
Wait baby girl throw it back
Old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane not hardly that
Smack you like I'm mad at that
Swear this sex so passionate
Oral sex she mastered that
Pornographic poses
Like she posing for the internet
Wait I was not finished yet
Never been a minute man
Always been a business man
Gotta catch your feelings man
Got a man?
Oh really now?
Acting like I give a damn!

Used to like her now I don't
Got a real short attention span
Gucci!

It's 4 in the mornin'

Gucci Trey Songz put it on
My shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song
She got on my favorite thong
She so hot
Too hot to touch
Truthfully too much for lames
Gucci mane I'm extra game
So extra rubbers I'm a bring
Got your main thang screaming Gucci
Every Tuesday night we cool whip
Wish we could do it more often
But I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet barbie
Aston martin double park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Pop her till she call me poppa
Freakin' partners
Why we never bother with a second option
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
With the very large knots 
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block

I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver 
Should have brought my phantom na, but I'm mad at my driver 
He so fuckin' turnt up, ridin' on auto pilot smokin' kush and smilin', 
He drinkin' while he drivin' 
Gucci please excuse me , huh, all my goons got jewelry on 'em 
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on there own 
I don't think you know me homie, I suggest you leave me alone 
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone 
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light 
Shinin' like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight 
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice 
I don't want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might 

[Chorus]

Now straight to the channel shop, that's how she shop 
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok 
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots 
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot 
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked 
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock 
If you talkin' to me tell me somethin' that I wanna know 
If she ain't got no money know you gotta have some doe 
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle 
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder 
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters 
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother 

[Chorus]

I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds 
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin' since a youngin'
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin' 
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion 
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday 
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions 
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky 
He cant buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits 
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigged 
My charm big as a midget 
I give yo ass the business 
So if you got yo swag right you know that you can get it",Boy from the Block,2010

Cocaine on the table wish the rappa got em choppin' logs
Twenty dolla' bills all rolled up, Wiz Khalifas rollin' pot
Jackie Chan is rollin' rollin', Yelawolf is powin' powin'
Slow motion got hos in motion, I think it's the perfect time
To put em in the mood, to put em in the car
Take em to the house and (what)
Take em to the moon, take em to the mouth
How we do it down south and (what)

Ghettovison is sewing, plowing, growing, growing
Crop dusting from a Boeing
Catfish Billy, on ya grill(ey)
Cook it up, make a meal(ey)

Drinkin' beer(ey), also chile
Fucked up but I'll tell you that I can't complain
Yelawolf and Gucci Mane keepin' yo bitch in a tame

40 carats on my bracelet, my Polo black
Niggas talking like they won't be wanting that

I'm riding in a mansion but I don't think I'm fancy
But I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancing
Once upon a time, a little while ago
There was a nigga in a 'Rari with a pretty yellow ho
Got my head held up cause I think I'm handsome
But the media portraying me as Charles Manson
And I could have bought a Phantom rode here four deeper
But I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow two-seater

How can I believe her
I don't even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her
I cant even trust myself
But I cant live alone
At the end of the day cant fuck myself
I told her I'm confused
And she told me to go fuck myself
Now I'm alone in this world
Nothing left but me
But I was born all alone
So I guess that's how its meant to be
But she was sent to me
And I didn't recognize
And I blame it on ma pride

I try to hug her she want more
In and out ah town all the time
She in and out ma mind all the time
I cant lie baby girl stupid fine
But I'm out the tush got that stupid grind
She loves me now or she loves me not
Treat me cold no she treat me hot
Caramel but not apricot
Got one chance wont miss the shot

I know someone might take ma spot
Cant lie it may hurt a lot

I'm talkin' homegirl be lookin' like she just stepped outta a magazine
I'm talkin' niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious

Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

[Chorus]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit

And this the remix and still I'm out here lookin'
For a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her
With a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

[Chorus]

See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick
She been strugglin' for hers
From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like Coming To America
All my Louis luggage
You see my bag, how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin' on to E-Trade

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time

Bye little Mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen

Cut the lights down, look at me now
Back then they didn't want me, now I'm hot and they all on me
Pull a bunch of these white bitches, I'm chillin hard at the Pink Pony
Gucci Mane and Meek Mills, I'm ballin hard, I'm too trill
New ride with new money, so I had to put it on new rims
Hawks game, I'm court side
Red bottles on the wet floor, give them up to the athletes
Smellin' like a pound of dro, Versace shades I'm yoked out
Rolls Royce it smoked out, parked in front your whole house
I blew the horn, she jumped out
Maybach on cascade, the one on down my west side
4 girls, only fucked 3
Cause one left, and she missed out

I'm the realest nigga living, let's get one thing clear
And if you wanna get it popping we can do it right here
I ain't never been embarrassed, I ain't never felt fear
I got post-traumatic stresses like I can't shed tears
I ain't even been out 6 months but I spent 6 mil
Got a million dollar grin and a 10 million dollar crib
And my heart done turnt burr-burr like my adlibs
In the kitchen going skrt-skrt tryna make a mil
Got these bitches screaming bling-blaow, diamonds in my ear
I send my shooters then it's pow-pow, another tatted tear
Yeah it's 2016 so it's Guwop year
When I was 16 I was making drug deals
These niggas say they getting money, I can't really tell
I made more money than them and I was in a jail cell

From the hat on my head to the shoes on my feet
Every garment on my body it come from overseas

I act like I forgot but I was once a mental patient
Sit still in a cell while my career deteriorated
Now everyday I wake up I feel invigorated
Got Rihanna on IG talking about Gucci's transformation
Minor setback for a major compilation
Meant to say comeback but I might drop a compilation
Sometimes I post a pic just so I can block all the haters
A lot of niggas sending threats I don't know what the wait is
They actin' like they tough but don't want no confrontation
These sucka's ain't even man enough to say congratulations
2018 20 year my high school graduation
I might go in my bag and send them on a paid vacation
You never sold a brick I understand the fascination
He think he a d-boy but really he's a scammer baby
I'm from east Atlanta by way of Alabama baby
Took so many bricks to 'Bama my pic should be laminated

I know my aunt lookin' down on me like
I'm glad you made it
I know my uncle lookin' down on me like

Ya ain't gon' cheat us on our paper 'cause we quicker than Cheetas
For all the non-believers
Who said it couldn't go down
From Fillmoe to Hunter's Point
Represent for your town
We got young San
In every cut of the city
Strapped up wit burned gloves
Coked out like Mitty
Tear a bo like them red nosed bitch, when glocks spit
Up in bullet proof vests
Strikin them suckas wit full clips
Shift this (shift this)
In Chevy Novas for them run-aways
Now-a-days hustlas stay over to bring 'em phatter pay
All Niner's wit no sleep
Sleepin wit they Nike's on waitin for creeps.

You get burned
When the heat was on
I turned
Turned to trouble
Trouble

[verse 1]
Yeah yeah c-3
New Orleans baby the street called eagle
And everybody's ill yea illegal
People steal cars we steal people
We eat like dogs but we're still people
And even when your lost trouble still see you
And even if your dead broke we are still equal
One time for the little people eat your meal
Don't let the meal eat you

(I run to trouble)
Street runners
Your running me crazy with this one
I
Run
With
Trouble

[Verse 2]
And just the other day my nigga Chris killed himself
I pray to god that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when theres no help
He figured heaven so he went left
Ya'll know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds come and bells ringing
(i run to trouble, trouble)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama know the drug dealers straight quit her job
He took his life and along with him I died
And she died
We died...
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me, ""daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes and see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over the 1
Still I look for better times
I run with trouble, trouble...

You know
Just kicking back
(Though I look for brighter times)
I am carter

The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans

And everything ain't what it seems

Don't play that game without your team
Kill for my bread
Kill for my g's
Kill for my cream
I will have that red beam on high beam
Now I hear sirens
Wait I think I see one behind me
I ain't tripping baby
Money got me, uh
And fuck the police
Fuck the feds too
I ain't jumping in that jumpsuit
A blunt too

Check me out
I fuck around and check you
Respect due
Pay yours nigga
Mines under the seat by my feet
Wheres your nigga
Too much whores nigga huh
Too much pressure
Too much force
Too much money
You never heard that before
Shit, and we stop these snitches at the door
Cut the tail off the rat he wont rat no more
Whack

Thats right
Get trapped fucking with my cheese
Keep shooting till I burn my sleeve
Nigga please
These boys is g's
Represent New Orleans like a Florida leash

This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news

I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee

Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs

Why you on that slang shit if you smoke that same shit

Covered in the soot from that bootstrap class, so
Get it how you're living and live in color of calico

Gudda Gudda,"Young Money, they go
Sittin' on the toilet, smokin' on some medicated
Countin' loose thousands, I'm living good, they aggravated
Two things on my mind, one is to keep stylin'
And the second is to get more of this shit that I'm counting
Call me J-2-0, I flow like a fountain
And I swear I beat the beat up till that bitch start ouchin'
Keep them bitches' asses bouncin', man we fly like a falcon
Comparing them to us is like a pebble to a mountain
I'm a uptown flamethrower young money fire starter
Had to sign to Wayne, I'm from the same place as ""Tha Carter"" Ha-Harlem
And I ain't like none of these other niggas
I get it, I spend it, your husband on a budget, Mrs.
Young Money cloud gang so above you niggas
Besides these groupies after the shows, who's fuckin' with us?
You might as well have a badge, the way you cuff them bitches
I slut them bitches, then back to the door, like fuck them bitches

Than a mu'fucka, this for my mu'fuckas

We say hello

I'm so Young Moolah baby

OK it's too much paper and not enough hands to count it
Paper coming in money never going outward
Its young money yeah I hear a lot of niggas doubting
This here is God's work, ain't nothing you can do about it
So nigga join the team or you can catch the sideline
And just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We makin' money while you niggas makin' petty quotes
You can make it rain, we make it flood like the levee broke
It's all about the paper, money control my whereabouts
About a year from now I'm tryin' to break that new McLaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip, Vanna White in it
Bitch shotgun, probably be your wife in it
Hustle year round nothing come in front of that
Rap real estate and work, I can make a ton with that
Pay me in advance so I'm not coming bitch
Like Pain, Wayne and Mack Maine, I got money bitch

[Chorus]

Yeah, Young Money I'm the boss, you don't wanna come across
Money do somersaults, Bentley on young adults
Stuntin' on them hoes, it ain't me, its the money folk
Still make it rain, get struck by a money bolt
What it is though, I know what it ain't
Y'all go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stubs, bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up and runnin', join the campaign

Times ain't the same, shit been goin' bad
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, 'cause it ain't what it was
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug
And a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch
I got that dope dick, there ain't a bitch I can't addict
And I'm lookin' at the game, I roll my eyes
I looked at the clock and the hands were tied because

Bitches get to stepping like Cole, Gina, Tommy
Pussy is a weapon and my hoes think I'm Simon
And Simon say go and get my motherfucking money
Young mula bitch, tell them hoes, take their clothes off
And I don't hunt birds but I'll shoot you in your Mohawk
Yeah, flow nasty like coleslaw
Call me mister no flaw

Yeah, I sip drank and pop pills til I dose off
Wake up, grab the mic then I go's off
Too G for office, boss of all bosses
Crucify rappers, nail niggas to the crosses
I'm fresh out the slaughterhouse, blood on my apron
We Louisanimals, watch me let the gators in
I'm going on my paper run, a week at the Days Inn
Icing on my fingertips, I be getting cake in

I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
It's that punting at your face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase bitch
David Banner on the beat hoe
And I beat the beat up like Dee Bo
I got the game on TiVo
So I guess you can say The Streets Is Watchin'

I don't promise much but I promise you that it'll flow boy
Name Jay but you can call me Millzbury Doughboy
Silence on the nine but the chopper make mo' noise
But if the bitch scream, I'm a pop her, no noise
Bank account top solid, Truck nice and brolic
The rims sticking out like the shoulders on Dwight Howard
You niggas ain't G's you gents and quite coward
But I'll put you higher than flight pilots

I am petrifying, The metal turn to lightning
Burn through your clothes like an ion
I am no american idol, no Simon Cowell
Wack niggas throw in the towel
I'm getting money with the rap, pay me by the vowel
I'm hungry like a pack of wolves so I just howl
Holla, Cash rules everything around me
So I'ma get the money, dolla dolla bills in them hundreds

I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
It's that punting at your face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase bitch
David Banner on the beat hoe
And I beat the beat up like Dee Bo
I got the game on TiVo
So I guess you can say The Streets Is Watchin'

Ugh, yo, yo yo,
I'm a bad what? bout to get a mani-ped
I'm the big bad wolf and your granny dead
Even though I'm in Mexico
I rep New York like Plexico
Look, switch my name, now I'm celebrating Hanukkah
Lewinsky bitches, young money Monica
I been hot since hedgehog, Sonic the
So could you pass me the keys to the Tonica
I mean Tonka, That's the truck bitches
Fuck you and fuck all of you fuck bitches
Matter of fact, put some sprinkles on my cupcakes
And get ready to put your dimples in this duct tape

I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
It's that punting at your face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase bitch
David Banner on the beat hoe
And I beat the beat up like Dee Bo

Uh yo yo
Let us begin with the bad lil' specimen
Balenciaga's is all these things I be steppin' in
Gucci bathing suits, only thing I'm dressin' in

Yeah fuck the bullshit
It's big money poppin'
Young Mula!
Yeah

What up young nigga
Lets go Gudda, brrat

Okay we runnin' this shit, when we walk in the building
Got bitches from wall to wall, hoes hangin' from the ceiling
Young Money we 'bout to kill 'em, I promise I'll make a million
And if they didn't have no hands, I'll bet them bitches go feel 'em
I'm talkin' money and power, you gettin' money? I doubt it
Fresher than baby powder, with your bitch in the shower
That pussy I'm a devour, I beat it up till it's sour
No need for you to even trip bitch I'll be done in a hour
Let's go!

Yeah,
That's more like it
Junior

They say the blacker the berry, the redder the cherry
I say sweeter it is, ya dig, buried
Then the bullshit varies, and it got me weary
But I know two of the same, call it murdered and married
Hustlin' is so necessary, with no adversaries
But ain't no love, like a calendar with no February's
I'm a need four secretary, and four bloody Mary's
I'm a go eat me some pussy, and choke up the cherry
I'm gone

Yeah
Fully loaded with it, to the ceiling with it
More money than you ever seen nigga
Aight, Drizzy, Drake

Look
Kill the game no one recovers the murder weapon
Young angel if ya hate me tell me burn in heaven
How'd you sleep on me, the highest earning freshmen
Like ya third infection, I hope ya learned ya lesson
Yeah
I spit raw but I prefer protection
I own her heart and her mind, and the shirt she slept in
Bitch I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut ya club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cakin' it
And I'm cakin' bitch, so tell me why I take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby, not the one she was in labor with
She say 'oh you taste good', I say 'oh just savor it'
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl I'm made of it",F*** Da Bulls***,2009

Sicker than your average you rappers is a** backwards
Gudda speak crack and you n****s is crack addicts
The simple mathematics.

Pretty b****es damn near feint when they pa**ing
Call my whip Martin but the first name Aston
Tata head n****s get mashed when I'm spazzin'
Think you f***ing with me put your cash in, nah I doubt
I was young and reckless when Pete say he was about it

Bulldozer boy and the target is the industry
Two things I love in the World, good head and victory
You ain't doing it big and broke stop kidding me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr T
This is Misery, no Cathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money slap ya straight
Yeah I'm a big joker so you know I slap you ace

Leave the club with ya girl send her home with an ashy face
Love is a gamble but it's my casino
Pretend that your the loser I hope that she (?)
I hope the game got life insurance

White girl on the table love them sniff nose candy
When I'm walking by the women say ' Who is that nigga?'
I replied 'Hi,I am Gudda Gudda that nigga'
I was raised in the home of da Cap Splitters
Whip on 24's watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy boy like a Happy Meal
And yous a muthafuckin' duck, Daffy Dill
I'm from the school of Hard Knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gunner, you can get the package deal
I'm hot nigga, burning everything around me
I was lost for a minute took a while but I found me
The streets say I'm King but the game will never crown me
Realist nigga doin' it just ask the niggas around me

But smart, very smart, too smart for ya knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It's Y.M.E. nothing gets in between us

Tell Wayne I'm going in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rocking with young money
I told my team I got us man it's all on me
Like volume 2 BG I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Everytime I'm on the track it's ransom
Can't find us anymore it's random

Strapped like Velcro and this we running hell no

We got these boys running like Forest
So salute me like a general
First place never last
Always on top and I'm a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in strangle hold no letting up
You can get the top, ya can pop like 7 Up
Knock knock let us up, young money applaud me
And we'll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

I'mma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn't given
Everything that I've given, I swear I'll never give in

Just look at what I've been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me,
'Cause young money is the Navy better yet the Army

Don't ask me about shit but money
Fuckin' right my money long I got that 10ft money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I'm in deep like wet pussy
I'm a purple heart proven war vet rookie
You can't even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me
Now don't step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building

Leave em with a pale face,
Yes, I am a young money goon,
Your girl like a motion picture she gon be coming soon,
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons,
I pass her off to Mills then drop her off the tune,
Couple screws lose, you wanna play with him,
This is No Ceilings b-tch, roofless like a stadium,
We shut down every f-cking spot these b-tches see us in,
You want us in your club well n-gga pay us then,

Tempo che dici ""wow"" ti ho sconvolto la vita
Estorto una firma, dato un colpo alla tua sgrilla che suda nivea
Prima del rap già ero un artista
Professionista del gratto se fanno il tele-gratto in lizza
Anche io ho una scimmia, hai presente le scimmie, i primati?
Beh, la mia, zio, è una scimmia da guinness dei primati
Business e derivati, Marra-caibo
Sono così il capo che dovrei stare a città del capo, zio

Ho tatuato un teschio nella pupilla
Ho fatto il primo disco per pochi pirla
Ho fatto il primo disco è stata scintilla
Ho scritto il primo testo quando è morto Claudio Villa
E mentre vomitavo la mia gioventù nei dischi
Mi hanno comprato date finanzieri e camorristi
Non è che ho guadagnato come fifty
Almeno non ho fatto come te che hai fatto fifty euro

Tenetevi i privè, tieniti l'underground
La strada riconosce a me il fattore ""wow""
È come un porsche coupé con a palla il mio sound
Tutto assettato e poi lanciato finché gridi ""wow""

Tempo che dici ""wow"" io tiro su il caos
Su un beat di don tondo più di un culo di Sao Pao
Zio, ciao, 'sta roba fa, è come l'effetto Axe
Ma non è un effetto, fra', è che c'è proprio Axe

Alle università potrei tenere i corsi
Votami alle elezioni, abolirei la tassa sulle successioni

Ero in barella quando tu spalmavi nutella

Non perché ieri ai negramaro c'ho inculato un premio

È rock senza le strato, collabo del millenio
Afferro grana e gloria e c'ho che ne ricavo

Gli occhi su di me, guarda lo straniero
Da criminale è passato a fare il feat con Gué Pequeno
Donne chic e Dompero, io ho sempre un flute pieno
Faccio cin cin, brindo col vostro veleno

Tu guarda tutte queste persone
Tu guarda tutte queste persone
Vorrebbero bruciassi come il sole
Vorrebbero bruciassi come il sole
Ma mi stanno attorno come l'occhio del ciclone

Scendo per strada e hanno gli occhi su di me
Alla tua serata hanno gli occhi su di me
Pure la tua donna tiene gli occhi su di me
Io, dovunque vado, ho sempre gli occhi su di me
Gli occhi su di me 
Gli occhi su di me
Gli occhi su di me
Gli occhi su di me

Flow doga, Saratoga che vi cuce quelle bocche
L'odore della notte, le anime corrotte
Il collo pieno d'oro, il cuore pieno d'odio
Gli occhi dei bastardi se ti vedono su un podio
Gli infami che tu servi, il mondo frate a pezzi
E ste sceme fanno i selfie, i fra' rischiano arresti
Tu per cosa moriresti? Vivo e muoio per i fra'
Vivo e muoio per 'sti testi, resto vero street Majestic
Se potessero i falliti che hanno gli occhi su di me
Mi lancerebbero il laser come il tipo degli X-Men
Odiano sta giacca qua da 4K di Balmain
Balenciaga su di un guercio per non far vedere che
Anche io ti guardo infame, sai che non c'entra il Rap
E tua madre è una troia come in Blow con Johnny Depp
Resti un uomo di merda, sai che non starò mai con te

Gli occhi su di me 
Gli occhi su di me
Gli occhi su di me
Gli occhi su di me

Ma non puoi rompermi come un diamante
Ma non puoi fottermi come un amante
Questi occhi, frate, ne hanno viste tante
Mi fotto questa vita finché tremano le gambe
Fast life, senza fermarmi un attimo
Così non vedo attorno, penso solo a farmi l'attico
Vita maranza, inseguendo il foglio viola, melanza
Tra me e il rap italiano, distanza
Mi stanno sul cazzo come un condom
Tutti tutti vogliono spolparmi come un condor
Tutti i fake e gli ipocriti del mondo
Non li penso con sta Grey e st'idroponica che sfondo
Se vedi nero, eclissi, sotto c'è sempre il sole
La fortuna non esiste, ho solo queste parole
Zero sogni nel cassetto, i fra hanno sogni nel pacchetto
Pensi al rap, io penso ai soldi, potere, rispetto

Dopo ti ho citofonato, come cazzo ho parcheggiato

Prego come in sinagoga che con tutta questa foga
Che ho, non dici no
Io non voglio se non voglio ma
Tu brilli come il mio Audemars
Biglietti come al cinema
Ti spogli e poi puoi farmi vedere
Farmi vedere
Poi torno da solo e non ci sto più tanto dentro

Senza senso di colpa, saremmo come animali
E adesso che volo verso Tortuga
Aspetto che ogni lacrima si asciuga
Con qualche bottiglia di Beluga
Vorrei un giorno lungo 25 ore
Per poter rimediare ad ogni mio errore
E capire che l'amore è superiore
Ma nuoto in una piscina di Xanax
L'unica che mi sta addosso è una nuova collana

Una bella cantante italiana
Con cui passare assieme questo fine settimana

Il rap che passa in radio in questi tempi funesti
È col ritornello pacco alla Gemelli Diversi
Dici: Se dovessi fare un feat. chi chiameresti?
Dico di fisso Emma, fratè non ho detto chiaveresti
Ma vedendo i suoi ex, penso che non capisca il mio swag
Manco conosce Kanye West
Sempre insoddisfatta, sempre che aspetta l'amore
Scrive un singolo migliore con Guè in un motel a ore
Se canto con Malika metto d'accordo la critica
Ma giusto una canzone, l'azione la vedo critica
E invece Baby K? Le insegnerei a rappare
In una cosa a tre con Bianca Atzei, mi darei da fare
Bè, Dolce Nera è un gran bel pezzo
Non ci faccio un pezzo
Chiara? Zero arrazzo manco il pezzo manco, mmh
Ha vinto un'altra cozza come l'edizione scorsa
Piuttosto che 'ste popstar una milf Anna Oxa

Sarà che sono di Barona, umorismo un po' da caserma
Ma Laurona è bona mozzarellona quasi materna
In più eterna per la timbrica e una che se la timbri, fra'
Già ci vedo schizzare in testa, alla classifica
Ho più di un sogno amoroso con l'Amoroso
Ha un viso che è clamoroso
Ma mi sa che c'ha il moroso
Son generoso e mi presto per il progetto

Vedo il futuro scuro nel fumo di una bottiglia

Tagliai i legami, uccidi i tuoi cari e riprendili solo quando da solo te la cavi

Se il mondo ti rifiuta
Il volto di un codardo è la nuca
L’uomo del mio tempo è ancora quello della clava
Solo che ora butta in rete la spazzatura
E non a caso l’esito
L’una è la notte, fra gli uomini vanno a mignotte
Sperando le fighe non lo diventino
Io vendico il tuo reddito
Non sento le rime dei rapper, perchè non soffro il solletico

Daredevil e Elektra
Pronta per la sfilata privata, paura
Sono il suo vestito su misura
Rime in selecta, non si accontenta
Ama il Tom Ford ma il mio flow è Beretta
Vogliono scaricarmi addosso un kalashnikov
È importato dalla Russia come la Kournikova
Stanotte sarà sangue nella disco 
E non mi salverà il dj
E morirò anche per amore 
Frà, sì, ma dopo di lei

Gué Pequeno,"Johnny era un bad boy
E finì dentro per una cazzata
I primi tempi erano duri e poi
So che si è preso anche qualche mazzata
Impara presto che la dentro nulla era graduato
In base al tipo di reato
E invece che a inseguire toccava far vedere
Tra servo e padrone chi sarebbe stato
Johnny era poco più di un ragazzino
Un giorno nella doccia trovò un marocchino
Il sangue scorreva a secchiate era marrone
Non era un film di Garrone
Poi fu come iniziare l’università
Con un esame al giorno tra le avversità
Scontando poi capisci si può darsi ma
Negli occhi un’altra luce incomincia a vedersi già

Punizione no soluzione, la malaeducazione
Punizione no soluzione, la malaeducazione
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar
Se jucan a fa mal
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar
Se jucan a fa mal

Nella testa di Johnny pensieri pesanti
Carichi neri come nuvole piovono pianti
Come tutti i lavori lui iniziò dal basso
La notte sempre sveglio pensando al primo passo
E tutti i giorni si ammazzava di flessioni
Preparandosi alla prima di molte missioni
Un'altra settimana la pelle dura squama
Ascoltava i vecchi e esercitava con la lama
Finalmente un giorno freddo che arriva il momento
Raddrizzare i torti e conti ed il regolamento
Durante l'ora d'aria li aspetta sulle scale
E Dio sa quanto gli fece male
Il giorno dopo tutti sai parlavano di lui
Dei muri delle celle e pure i corridoi
Perché qua diventi grande anche se non vuoi
Johnny era un bad boy

Il cielo non aveva nome
La terra non aveva nome
Lì dentro, tutto non aveva nome
Non aveva un nome

Se jucan a fa mal
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar

Quando Johnny è uscito aveva un'altra faccia
Un'altra stazza rappresentava una minaccia
Ad aspettarlo gente che non ho mai visto
Riverito e idolatrato come Gesù Cristo
E lì ho capito che sto stato l'aveva educato
È uscito laureato a pieni voti
E lì ho capito quando mi ha salutato 
Che con Johnny adesso non ci fotti
E non è colpa sua fra non dico che è brutto 
Dentro senza sapere niente l'ha tipo distrutto
Ora le strade qua si preparano all'urto
Perché Johnny è uscito e presto si prenderà tutto

Pensavo che con la musica ci avrei comprato un jet
Così mi svegliavo a sud e mi addormentavo ad est

Tra criminali micro, milli-milionario macro

Ma qua aspetto e spero il settimo zero
Chiudo gli occhi e penso un giorno a diventarlo per davvero

Ma se io fossi milionari-ari-ari-ario
Porterei tutti i miei amici via dal gabbi-abbi-o
Lancerei le banconote da una cabri-abri-o

Take money, money, money

E frate sono guai, sperano che non li hai, ti odiano se poi li fai

Coi rotoli di soldi chiusi insieme con gli elastici

Al collo tre ghiaccioli un nuovo freezer sul polso (bling bling)
Sto cantando soldi sono l’affare in questo gioco
Quando mi vede fa “wow” (oddio)
Da Gucci mi fanno “ciao” (ciao)
La mia faccia su Playboy (ehi)
Tesoro chiamami soldi (“let’s get it”)
Con un infame non hablo con la tua tipa mi scaldo
Dico soltanto verità baby puoi chiamarmi Pablo (skrt)
Yah yah

Entro nel locale festa come il primo maggio
Vendo pezzi d’arte come un Cara-Caravaggio (skrt)
Tu lo sai chi sei, con un insetto io non parlo
Perché sei uno scarafaggio scara-scara-scarafaggio

Se ora non ti spogli
Cazzo sei venuta a fare?
Se non hai portato i soldi
Cazzo sei venuto a fare?

Allaccio ste Nike sotto un pantalone stretto
Ho fatto più fatti di quante parole ho detto
Ho amici ai piani alti e amici pure giù nel ghetto
I boss e i soldati qua mi portano rispetto
Il soldo è il mio di per questo lo rispetto
Ed io il suo profeta come Allah con Maometto
Manda il tuo sicario finisci nell’acquario
Fratelli in galera e pure nell’aldilà
Che vegliano sulla mia testa e sopra la città

Scrolliamoci questi scarafaggi di dosso

Che sgamano la password del tuo Facebook
Che quando vai a ballare con le tipe al club
Devi pagare tutto e perdi la drink card
Che smetti di stalkerizzarmi su Whatsapp

Che all'aeroporto scordi il fumo in tasca

E tu sei sponsorizzata con poco
Quante lettere d'amore sono state scritte
Che spero non ti vengano poi mai spedite
Nessuno c'ha problemi zero
Nessuno qua è contento per davvero

Sogno che sono morto, il mio corpo in strada, la processione
Tra bur buono e Burbuka
Imbazzato, fumo un bazooka

Farfalle nello stomaco, dammi l'insetticida
Voglio ridisegnare il mondo, dammi una matita
Voglio ridere come non avessi mai pianto
Voglio la luna e camminarci sopra come Armstrong

Ma il giorno dopo già non provavo più niente
Portami sulle onde dell'oceano quando si alzano
Uccidimi e fammi risorgere come con Lazzaro

Fuori carri e carnevali, dentro carri armati
I miei amici vaporizzati, gialli a Nagasaki
Questo intestino è in 24 carati
Stati d'animo in centoquaranta caratteri
E non so chi tu pensi io sia
La realtà non è all'altezza della fantasia
Certe idee che mi accarezzano e che scaccio via
Un brivido che faccia breccia nella mia apatia
Non sei più mia e ti trovo male

(Tu tu tu) tu non dire a me come devo fare il rapper

Ha, Marracash
Barona, Milano
Street rap dal 2003
E se venite dal quartiere e volete fare i rappers è anche grazie a me
Per tutti quelli che vogliono fare i criminali al microfono
La strada si fa in strada
Questa è musica
Conta la musica, zio
Heh, non è una gara a chi fa più brutto
Non è una gara a chi è più duro
Sinceramente non ce ne fotte un cazzo
Pensa al tuo business che io penso al mio
Prega il tuo dio che io prego il mio

No, non agitarti, resta immobile
Puoi metterci anni, e guardare ogni cosa che
Affonda nelle sabbie mobili
Si perde, nelle sabbie mobili

Penso spesso che, potrei farlo (sì)
Andare via di punto in bianco, cosi, altra città, altro stato (ah)
Potrei se avessi il coraggio
Ho un orizzonte limitato, è follia stare qua
È miraggio (follia), che basti essere capaci
Quanti ne ho visti scavalcarmi (ah), rampolli (ah), rapaci (ah), raccomandati
Quanti ne ho visti fare viaggi, e dopo non tornare (ah)
E restare (ah), spaccare (ah) e affermarsi
Qui non c'è il mito di chi si è fatto da solo
Perché chi si è fatto da solo di solito è corrotto
Se sei un ragazzo ambizioso in un sistema corrotto
Non puoi fare il botto e non uscirne più sporco (ah)
Nessuno lascia le poltrone, niente si muove (zero)
Nessuno osa e nessuno da un'occasione (sì)
Impantanati in queste sabbie mobili, si muore comodi

Parto dal principio, io della scuola ricordo un ficus
Cioè la pianta che aveva il preside in ufficio
Vale più il mio testo letto in diretta da Linus (sì)
Il paese ha un virus, una paralisi da ictus
Come prima, più di prima
Madonna, potrebbe essere mia nonna
A cinquanta anni ancora a pecorina
È il nulla, come la storia infinita
Come la mummia che si sveglia e torna in vita, puzza di muffa
The Beautiful People, The Beautiful People
La bella gente pratica il cannibalismo, sa di già visto
Come un film di cui capisci la fine già dall'inizio
E i vecchi stanno al potere, non vanno all'ospizio
Se MTV sta per Music Television
Vorremmo più video e meno reality e fiction (ah)
Sono pesante apposta come chi fa sumo
E tu fai musica che piace a tanti e non fa impazzire nessuno

No, non agitarti, resta immobile
Puoi metterci anni, e guardare ogni cosa che
Affonda nelle sabbie mobili
Si perde, nelle sabbie mobili

Niente di nuovo, niente di che (oh)
Quel rapper che ti piace non dice niente di sé (oh)
Solo cliché, attacca il premier
Come se quando cadrà il premier vincerà il bene
Se non ci fosse, di che parlerebbe?
Chi comanda è lì da sempre, e non si elegge con il voto
E prende decisioni senza cuore e senza quorum
E se tornassi indietro io lo rifarei
Il mio incubo era fare la vita dei miei
Sì, quella vita strizzata, in otto ore compressa
La sera sei stanco, c'hai mal di testa, compressa
Fuori onda il direttore dice che ho ragione
Ma non ci crede, come chi brinda ma poi non beve
Non prendere la bufala, che tanto non è bufala, è una bufala
Hai una chance di andartene, fra', usala
Se riesci sei un genio, se fallisci sei uno zero
E se fai quello che fanno gli altri rischi di meno, quindi

Non mi frega un cazzo di fare la guerra di questo rap italiano
Sul beat ve le diamo adesso, anche in prima acceleriamo

Quindi con nessuno abbasso il capo
Passami il sale non mangio sciapo

Fra farebbe eccitare anche San Tommaso
Chiudo il gioco a chiave
Metto in salvo il vaso

A gara di cazzi vi batto col mignolo

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!
Este nivel solamente es alcanzado por aquellas súper-estrellas!
Lo único que, ahora, junto a Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Estas son ""Las Gárgolas: The Next Generation""!
Prra!

Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Ahí les dejo al mío!
Mario!
Comételos vivo!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24
(¡Jajajaja!)

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen

Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

(¡Angel Doze!)
(¡Jajajaja!)
Estos cabrones quieren que los dejemos feos
No bromeo y no les tengo miedo a los feos
Soy guerrillero y en la calle como les campeo
Mucha cazaera, mujeres y fumeteo
Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

(¡Es el turno del gorila!)
Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal
Yo no vo'a atacar si tu combo saca'l* (¿?)
De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Tienes que ser el flow, brother!
A la buena o a la mala!
Cohitre de monte!
Y es que son años, mi pana, luchando!
Imagínate, ""Las Gárgolas"" otra vez!
El mismo flavor, otra vez!
Los veteranos!
Y la nueva generación!
Tiene que ser saoco!
Tu sabes!
Las gárgolas!
En la calle!
En la clave!
En el corazón del pueblo!
Eso tiene que ser!",Pa' Mi Ponce (Intro),2007

We specialize in lingerie
Walkin' like you on a runway scrounge

Man I'm killin this track until it fades out
Shake da bottle den release the cork
And let it spray out, spray dese broads down

Why you wearin a fur mothafucka it's rainin
You look like a fool for girls what chu gamin
You should think about goin home and changing

Cadillac escalade what I get brains in
Rollin my eyes to the back of my head like I'm trippin on heron
Got my head on sped on

There's no reason I'm as evil as I can be
I pray to Jesus please keep my mind at peace
I just want to stay humble and patient
that's when stupid niggaz come at you with gay shit
He look like Big, he sound like Big
Yo I'm be	-L-A-see-K nigga you dig
I guess it all started when Keesh left this earth dog
And the doc gave me my worst call
And told me that my boo goin through convulsions
Imagine my mind state and emotions
Hell my moms goin though it with my step pops
He got cancer in his lungs and his chest's rottin
All I wanted to do was be a winner
All I ever ate was hot dogs and chips for dinner
I sacrificed so much for my career
That's why my eyes shed blood for tears

[Chorus] x4
In my heart it burns this fire
and I don't fear none of y'all

[Verse 2]
I been in the industry for a year now
All my life I wished for this I'm here now
I didn't know it was so much politickinI feel like a motherfuckin' politician
Just yesterday I was out there hustlin'
Did a three song demo, now they want me in
Nines and four fives, pots and drawers
Got Virgin callin me with P Farmer
Give shoutouts to my niggaz down and rich
They was with me ever since I was on the bench
When I had no shoes, had no clothes, had no food
Had no dough, had no hoes
Shit was real thirsty back in them times
Like Martin Lawrence a Real Thin Line
I ran across a few real niggaz, a lotta hatin' niggaz, a lot of fake niggaz
Oh lord

In my heart it burns this fire
and I don't fear none of y'all

If I see you round the way and you catch me in the hood
show me love, nigga show me love
If I see you rollin a spliff and you separate the seeds from the buds
Let me get a puff
If you see me pissed off with the hammer in my hand, loadin' slugs
Nigga I'm a thug
If you see me with a bitch that you never seen before
I'mma fuck or nigga I done fucked
I remember when I was just a little boy
Watchin' moms play that organ with that big voice
It touched me in a certain type of way
Like the rhyme smooth sounds of Marvin Gaye
I didn't know Compton was like that
Until I got out there and had to fight back
Walkin' back and forth up the way-ly
Them Lucas Park niggaz tried to beat me daily
I guess that shit made me tougher
that's why I love every last one of my brothers
Hide always, they're with me in the struggle
Whether I'm glad or sad I'mma always love 'em
The game is so fuckin' treacherous
A buncha bullshit niggaz, fuck y'all rhetoric

You were My First, my last, and my only
Ever since you left I've been lonely
I can't find no love in my homies
Yooouuu allwayys was true (2X)

I knew it, ever since I started see'in ya
A few body scars, a few misdemeanors
You was down when nobody else was down
Helped me stacked the pounds, kept the gat in ya blouse
I admit I used to fuck around a little bit
But I knew that you would always be my chick
You be my shit talk, and next she be in black and blue
It was true I always had to have you
I can still smell the curry shrimp and rice
You'se the only one I ever trusted with my life, shit
I'd like to break up, to make-up, to make love
Them was some of the best times that we ever was

Chorus - 2X

I remember them bitches they tried to hit your sister
Both look at you and got their ass shook up
You was crazy, I was crazier for being with you
Everybody said I shouldn't, I didn't listen
Stealing me outfits for birthdays and holidays
Snatchin shit up with your purse, up at Robinson-Mays
Cleanin the shells at Victoria Secret
Going diamond lovey, and sell it on weekends
You used to say never give the dick away
And if I did me and that bitch just disappear away
Brown Traps I love you like a brother
Everytime when she tired she reminds me of her
My mother, my brother I love'em to the death
No matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less
Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, no matter what they say I wouldn't love you any less

A day M. Felicish Orlean rest in peace
Part of my heart's gold
It was me and you against the world baby but we helped our own
Some times they went wrong some times they went right
It was the petty shit the reason we fuss and fight
We was closer, than the coast of Nosetrub
Everybody thought they didn't know us
I knew that you was be having my baby
I was scared he be broke, he grow up the same way
If it was up to me you wouldn't have to work for shit
We can live great on the states and live mad rich

Soldier you was and soldier forever, and ever

And it's like, I ain't even tripping
I can't let things like that, get up under my skin
I can't win, if a nigga steady be living in sin
I gotta keep a right mind, if I want to make dividends
Sneak into the negative side, of my life
Even niggaz that I had love fo', turned fake
One of my real niggaz, just got shot nine times
From a nigga, that everybody really thought was down
And who the fuck can I trust, when I grab a glock to bust
The situation that I be facing'd, make a nigga think
Shedding tears over my older brother, gonna wait
For the rest of his life, because of these niggaz living shife
For real, now tell me where the love at
Why all of my niggaz, want to be acting like that
Is it because of the fact I'm one of the Maab, and never gon fall
And all the diamonds shine, when it's time to ball
Will they comfort me if I waited, it was gonna get greater later
I really hope so, cause I believe in God
And with the life that I live, I want to smile again
And if I die tonight, I still want to see the light

Hate make a nigga, stronger inside
But Dougie making the climb, but Lord knows that my body is tired
I need a little compassion, a little mo' breath in this rhyme
And I really just don't understand, why nigga want to be doing
The evil deed, and they want to hate on us
Cause they can't fade all us, but if you know like a nigga know
You niggaz would keep your distance, cause we can't be touched

Wish I would of known then, what I know now

I'm trying to stay away, from the triple beam
I gotta get up on a mission, it seems
Because I'm sick and tired, of dealing with the struggle and pain
The predicaments are facing me, having stress on my brain
Don't want to go up insane, pray to God that my soul
I'm going deranged, and anybody want to think to testing

Gotta be watching my back, and avoid the fakes
Really don't give a damn, what none of you hoes think
How many mo' niggaz, want to try my skills
Struggling hard, I'm trying to pay my bills
Never really know, who my friend or foes
Watch my friends, and keep my enemies close
All around the world, we may go
Still remain, to be the same old song
You say you be feeling me, but I don't know
You prolly just want to be, backstage at a show
Telling everybody you know, Guerilla Maab
Riding our dick, must be your big job

Maab is on the rise
Ain't nobody holding us down
Maab is on the rise
Ain't nobody stopping us now

Hey, hey

Finally we done made our way
Everything that come in the past, came today
I been looking in the future, for a brighter day
Trials and tribulations in life, I learn to evade
The sun is shining, every dog has his bone in time
And it seems to be, that my time is now
I remember, when they said I would be nothing
But now that nothing is something, and I be bringing 'em down
Sho' I'm a clown, nothing but the skill when I be wrecking
Up out of Texas, with diamonds all over my necklace
I keep they head checking, pass to profession
And can't nobody contest, 'cause that's the way we are a legend
You better count your blessings, 'cause I'm sick and tired of this thang
And while I be blowing my Mary Jane, I'm chilling with thugs
Sipping on mud, trying to keep my head long from slugs
Guerilla Maab on the rise, and we keeping it crunk

It was all a dream, other people said I would never be
Nothing, now collecting dividends to ride a Benz
Down I-10, dropping the top in the wind
With a friend once again, yelling out fuck friends
Bubble lens, when I be stacking my ends
Trying to see, could you really picture me
S3 with a JVC, 18's in the trunk ready to beat
Chunking deuce to hoes, and burning off on them freaks
I'm a ghetto superstar, and a certified thug
So all you certified scrubs, get certified slugs
Southside till I'm dead, gotta be moving they head
Gotta keep my head up, for my brother in the FED
This is dedicated to niggaz, who be turning they back
Slamming all of they do's, and burning off in they Lac
Since we done made it, they don't really know how to act
Guerilla Maab's on the rise, and stacking platinum placks

Hey, hey

All I did was put a buzz 
In everybody mutherfucking ear, about the group I'm in
Now look at the candy coupe I'm in
I took a big six hundred to the shop, and told em candy blue my Benz
I put a bunch of money in my billfold, 'cause I'm real cold
When I'm on the microphone
Everybody want to kill, to get a piece of my mill
But I'mma weigh my skills, better surrender or bite my chrome
'Cause I'mma fight my homeboys, write my own bars
When it comes, to the pen and pad
Thinking about the swine I had, and everything I own
Could the shit wasn't bad, but in reality nigga
I was fucked up low life, living in sin
But I was given a chance, to start pimping a pen
Now Blockbuster, Soundwaves and Sam Goody's
Be running out of my product, and re-order again
And certify myself, half a million sold
Guerilla Maab nationwide, nigga all in the stores
A yellow bitch, I'mma put my dick all in a hoe
A nigga want to plex, put his face all in the flo'
My foot all in the do', and coming in and out my barge
Maseratti and a Benz, got 'em in the garage
And put a whole card, and a pool in my backyard
A Guerilla Maab superstar, you can't hold me down

Comin' down
Hold up
Smoke somethin'

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time
Time

[Chorus]
Is'a playa
Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me
I'm the Twista, I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy
Damn skippy, gamin' it from a shot of Mississippi, now pimp on

He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New, and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought? Well, bless my soul, Well, who'd have known?

Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?

It's so peculiar, wait and see, we'll wait and see a few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

Here's a thought, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before

Em cada retrato um gatilho
Aguento dez noites a fio
O frio no estômago liso

E cada resposta é contrária
Ao sopro que vaza da mente
Descanso o ouvido num tiro
No grito mais alto que posso
