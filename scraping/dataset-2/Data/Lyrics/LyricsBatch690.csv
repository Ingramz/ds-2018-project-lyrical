Mary Bond Davis,"Life is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure 
What we do here below
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around

Mary Boquitas,"Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind 
For you don't belong to me
You heart belongs to someone else
 
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
 
Don't you remember the day 
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely 
Prayed for you only, my love

Why should I keep loving you 
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue

You should know by now am down with you

Girl there you go again constantly questioning
Where I'm gone, where I've been and where I'm coming from, yeah
Is that so hard to see you mean the world to me
Just because I'm hanging out don't mean that I'm playing around
It's all about you

All this time I've been with you
You should know by now am down with you

You're like a precious stone, I'll never you leave you alone
Word is bond, you turn me on so, don't be so possessive baby
I'd be a fool to risk losing a love like this

Mary Byrne,"This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a women or a girl

You see, man made the car
To take us over the road
Man made the train 
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electrolight
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat full of water
Like Noah made the arc

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a women or a girl

Man thinks about little bit of baby girls and a baby boys
Man make them happy
Cos man make them toys
And after man make everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing
Without a women or a girl

He's lost in bitterness",It's a Man's Man's Man's World,2011

Took my hand
Touched my heart
Held me close
You were always there

By my side
Night and day
Through it all
Maybe come what may

Swept away on a wave of emotion
Overcaught in the eye of the storm
And whenever you smile
I can hardly believe that you´re mine
Believe that you´re mine

This love is 
It´s unmistakeable
And each time I look in your eyes
I know why

Oh baby, I know why
This love is unbreakable

[Bryan:]
Shared the laughter
Shared the tears
We both know
We´ll go on from here

Cause together we are strong
In my arms
That´s where you belong

I´ve been blessed by the power of love
And whenever you smile
I can hardly believe that you´re mine

Mary C. Ford,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven

Mary Carewe,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [Cats],1988
Mary Carewe,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye,1995
Mary Carewe,"Ring out the old
Bring in the new
A midnight wish to share with you
Your lips are warm, my head is light
Were we in love before tonight?

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

No need to hear the music play
Your eyes say all there is to say
The stars can fade
And they can shine
Long as your face is next to mine

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

It's New Year's Eve, and hopes are high
Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye
Another chance, another start
So many dreams to tease the heart

Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year",The Perfect Year,1995
Mary Carewe,"They don't want me any more
They all say I'm through 
Well it's time they knew 

With on look 
I can break your heart 
With one look 
I play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one smile 
I'm the girl next door 
Or the love that you've hungered for 
When I speak it's with my soul 
I can play any role 

No words can tell 
The stories my eyes tell 
Watch me when I frown 
You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look 
Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry

With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last

This time I'm staying 
I'm staying for good 
I'll be back 
Where I was born to be

I'll be me",With One Look,1995
Mary Carewe,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time:
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina...

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true",Don't Cry for Me Argentina,2000
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"There ain't a lot that you can do in this town.
You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around.
You go to school and you learn to read and write.
So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life.

I work at the fillin' station on the interstate.
Pumpin' gasoline and countin' out of state plates.
They ask me how far into Memphis girl, and where's the nearest beer.
And they don't even know that there's a town around here.
Someday I'm finally gonna let go.
Cause I know there's a better way.
And I want to know what's over that rainbow.
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

Now my brother went to college cause he played football.
I'm still hangin' round cause I'm a little bit small.
I got me a '67 Chevy, she's low and sleek and black.
Someday I'll put her on the interstate and never look back.",Someday,
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Slowly as you look at me 
In your eyes I can't believe 
All the love I'm seeing now 
Plain as day to me somehow 
Oh, love, come on home

Promises a heart can keep 
Happiness is you and me 
Never was a dream so right 
Love has finally come in sight 
Oh, love, come on home

You fit into my life and 
You seem so right, like someone planned it 
You give yourself to me and 
You give so easily
Seems like you always understand

Growing old with you someday

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Outside another yellow moon 
Has punched a hole in the nighttime 
I climb through the window and down to the street 
I'm shining like a new dime 
The downtown trains are full 
With all those Brooklyn girls 
They try so hard to break out of their little world

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows 
They have nothing that will never capture your heart 
They're just thorns without the rose 
Oh, be careful of them in the dark

And if I was the one 
You chose to be your only one 
Oh, baby, now, can't you hear me now?

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night is just the same?
You leave me lonely now

I know your window and I know it's late 
I know your stairs and your doorway 
I walk down your street and past your gate 
I stand by the light at the four-way

You watch them as they fall 
Oh, they all have heart-attacks 
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night, every night is just the same?
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night, every night is just the same
All upon a downtown train?

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night, every night is just the same?
You leave me lonely 
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where all my dreams just fall like the rain
All upon a downtown train?",Downtown Train,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Last Sunday we got in the car and we drove 
To the town you were raised in, your boyhood home 
The trees were just turning, up on the ridge 
And this was your valley when you were a kid 
You showed me the railroad that your daddy worked on  
As we neared the old house where your granny lives on 
She's nearing ninety years now, with her daughters by her side 
Who tend the places in the heart where loneliness can hide

[Chorus]
Raised by the women who are stronger than you know 
A patchwork quilt of memory only women could have sewn 
The threads were stitched by family hands, protected from the moth 
By your mother and her mother--the weavers of your cloth

Your grandmother owned a gun in 1932
When times were bad just everywhere; you said she used it too 
And the life and times of everyone are traced inside their palms 
Her skin may be so weathered, but her grip is still so strong 
And I see your eyes belong to her and to your mama too 
A slice of Virginia sky, the clearest shade of blue

[Chorus]

And a rich man you might never be; they'd love you just the same 
They've handed down so much to you besides your Christian name 
And the spoken word won't heal you like the laying on of hands 
Belonging to the ones who raised you to a man

[Chorus]",Family Hands,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Heroes and heroines are scarcer than they've ever been 
So much more to lose than win 
The distance never greater 
Way back when you made history 
By flying planes across the sea 
Embarking on your odyssey 
You put away the danger

Heaven bless the one who flies 
A pioneer on frontier skies 
The world was dark and your only mark 
Was the light of the northern star 
I imagine what was in your eyes 
The seeds of rust and days gone by 
Your wings hang in a gallery sky 
I wonder how you're flying

Way out on the western plains 
The snow drifts high and the dust wind burns 
The Chinooks blow their winds across the mountains 
A life that's never safe and dry 
Rodeos and riding high 
Ladies and their men get by 
On six-guns and white lightning 

Heaven bless them on the road 
Those drifters and their dreams of gold 
The world was wide and cowboy's soul 
Could span the whole horizon 
I imagine what was in your eyes 
The dust and the dirt under outlaw skies 
A piece of land and a stubborn mind 
Were the only things worth having

Now they say the moon is dust and ash 
California's made of cash 
We're waiting for those hills to crash 
Into the sparkling waters 
Rain and snow and sun and wind 
You roamed the earth and you spread your wings 
And long ago, my heroes' dreams 
Belonged to all God's creatures

Heaven bless the ones who sleep 
The ones who laugh and the ones who weep 
Heaven bless the ones who keep 
Their bearings strong and certain 
And Lord help the fool who said 
You'd better quit while you're ahead 
A dreamer born is a hero bred 
On earth and up in heaven 
Lord help the fool who said 
You'd better quit while you're ahead 
A dreamer born is a hero bred 
On earth and up in heaven",Heroes and Heroines,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Years ago in my hometown I was a headstrong girl and a heart-strong one
We'd ride all summer with the top rolled down through the sleepy streets of that Jersey town 
Now I knew girls when I was sixteen 
Could make a smart boy stutter, turn a nice boy mean 
And the boys made the girls into homecoming queens 
Married each other instead of their dreams

[Chorus]
These days I'm mostly out on my own 
Looking for someplace that I can call home 
Late at night or just before dawn 
I pretend you're with me now 
It never seemed that hard before 
What happened to that hometown girl?

The seasons changed in my hometown 
The way they changed in yours 
The windows opened up to the spring 
Like every spring before 
And I ran with boys who weren't like you 
I was young, but somehow I knew 
The difference between a man and a fool 
Sometimes I think that could have been you

[Chorus]

Hometown girls are like hometown dreams 
Some start fading, others stay keen 
I won't forget you, but I'll let you be 
Love never was that kind to me

Late at night or just before dawn 
I pretend you're with me now 
You had your madness and you had your charm 
But only when your heart allowed 
And my heart just won't allow no more 
What happened to that hometown girl?",Hometown Girl,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Have you ever loved someone you knew nothing of 
Except you'd seen the light inside their eyes?
Have you ever loved someone just because 
Nothing felt so easy or so right?

And I think of you like the others do 
Wondering if you think of me 
And if you do, if you really do 
Who is it that you see?

Have you ever loved 
Whether right or wrong
Have you ever loved someone 
Just because?

Have you ever tried to speak the truth instead of lie 
When it seemed you had everything to lose?
Have you ever tried to stand your ground instead of hide 
When staying only made you look a fool?

And I stayed by you though I think I knew 
It wouldn't change a thing 
Changes come to hearts with ease 
But they come so hard to me 
Have you ever tried to make it last, not knowing why 
Except you had to try 
Just because?

And every day that passes now
I suppose I'm getting older 
Wiser with the things I've done 
But I hope I don't grow colder

And now I see the ones who've lost so much 
They swear they're done 
With love and all the chance it brings for pain 
But have you ever touched, and by itself it was enough 
To make you want to reach out once again?

And I'll touch you when I need a friend 
Or just a small reminder 
That I haven't grown too cold to feel 
You penetrate my armor

Have you ever loved 
Whether right or wrong 
Have you ever loved someone 
Just because?
Have you ever loved someone 
Just because?",Just Because,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"He was a long, tall stranger from way down south 
Where he'd left his life behind 
He had a big, old Gibson and a pickup truck 
And Shenandoah eyes 
And I remember him sitting in that local bar 
Where I earned my pay each night 
Singing my songs to empty chairs and going home half tight

So the nights rolled by like headlights shining on a lonesome strip of tar 
I kept his word of kindness close to me like a pick on my guitar 
And we talked about the singers and the songs we loved 
And the songs we'd most forgot 
In that run-down bar they'd make last call 
And I'd never want to stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I was living on nothing but a young girl's dreams 
With my cowboy boots and my old six-string 
Hitching my wagon to a star
Dreaming of leaving those local bars 
When I'd get him up at closing time 
For a couple of songs and a chance to shine 
Like the star that he longed to be 
He looked a hell of a lot like me

Well, he'd played a lot of places where the only wages were food and beer for free 
No fancy licks, but he had him a gift for the kinds of songs he'd sing 
But you do what you can to be a satisfied man 
Just to have your peace of mind 
So he gave it all up for a government job where the paychecks come on time

So now he comes to the bar to hear me play guitar 
And to share a drink or two 
And we sit swapping tales of where we've been and what we'd rather do 
There's a wealth of dangers when you're talking to strangers 
And I meet them all the time 
But my heart knew better than my head when I looked into those eyes

[Chorus]

Well, maybe I'll quit when I've got me a kid and a place to call my own 
But tonight there ain't nobody there waiting up for me at home 
It's a helluva way to live from day to day 
Not knowing where you're bound 
But the look in his eyes made me realize 
I was glad for the life I'd found

[Chorus]",A Lot Like Me,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The whippoorwills were crying in the falling rain 
Far away a whistle hailed a passing train 
Out in the country summer was almost gone 
The fields were turning rusty and the hills were turning brown

Now I think of you when summer stars are on the rise 
I think of you with a bottle of wine and lazy eyes 
Playing rock-'n'-roll songs on an old guitar 
Getting drunk and sleeping out in my backyard

[Chorus]
Now sometimes I just lie awake and I hear the wind 
Blowing through the seasons of my heart again 
My dreams are mostly lost and found on other streets and other towns 
But, babe, you know, I still look out for you

The cars were all abandoned on the city streets 
When snow had left us stranded then we used our feet 
And wound up drinking whiskey in a crowded bar 
And now when it starts storming I wonder where you are

'Cause you said that I was crazy to believe in you 
You said to never trust a man who sings the blues 
Well, trust and that old guitar was all you'd ever need 
If you found a way to love the girl in me

[Chorus]

Other boys I knew were just like shiny dimes 
Tossed and spent, they came and went a hundred times 
Nothing was as rough on me as giving up on you

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"He pulled out in a cloud of dust
Laying rubber and spewing rust
And on any road he'd take
He'd have his foot on the pedal and my heart on the brake
Underneath the smooth tar curves
A road is only dust and dirt
On a lonely interchange
The signs all look the same
'Cause a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Waterloo to Wichita
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, 100 miles ago
His wheels spun out of sight of me
Believing that I'd set him free
But I'd heard the voice of the prisoner
Saying he couldn't get enough of her
You go by land, you go by air
You go by sea, hell I don't care
You can go any way you choose
Wearing out the soles of your traveling shoes
And a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Bangor, Maine to Bakersfield
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, a hundred miles ago
And every sleepless night I see him
Screaming by the scenery
Not noticing another mile
That's rolled down between him and me
'Cause a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Saskatoon to San Antone
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, a hundred miles ago
Yes, a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from San Bernardino to Sault Ste. Marie
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, a hundred miles ago",A Road Is Just a Road,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Fetch me a glass; let's fill it with fine romance 
Pour slow the wine, then let your eyes kiss mine 
You, you with the charming eyes 
Lately I've found myself truly beguiled 
If this is a waltz, then I can't refuse 
To dance with a man like you

She must be fine; she must be enchantingly kind 
And she must be fair and never reveal that she cares 
Then, then when you've got her heart 
Spin her around till she begs you to stop 
But this is a waltz and no lady refuses 
To dance with a man like you

And if she inquires the meaning of love 
You'll silence her words with a glance 
And if she desires to wonder and pause 
You'll charmingly ask her to dance

You promised me that you would forever be kind 
And if meant to be, our love would find comfort in time 
Now, now that you feel no more 
How could I follow you out to the floor?
And now it's the waltz, but I have to refuse 
To dance with a man like you 
But this is your waltz and you'll find someone new 
To dance with a man like you",Waltz,1987
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Fields of green by the side of the road
Going down in Mary's land
Roll down the window feel the cool of a grove
Hit the palm of your outstretched hand

Fiddle and an old time band
Race with the moon to the edge of the water
Down in Mary's land
Down in Mary's land
East of Virginia where the bay meets a river
Down in Mary's land
The wind pulls your sleeve like a long lost lover
Whose heart can't understand
How you ever could leave
The view you behold
Ain't it fine and ain't life grand
When you don't need nothing
But some beer and a bushel
Down in Mary's land
Gonna sleep with the stars
And a slice of the moon
Hanging right above my bed
Gonna dream not of things
That I've left behind
But those I've found instead

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Every night she sleeps alone
And by her bed she puts the phone
And every morning after that
She takes the phone and puts it back

He's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

She keeps his picture tucked away
She thinks she'll have it framed one day
And maybe he'll come see it there
Hanging by her rocking chair

In a corner of her room on a Sunday afternoon
When all the world is dull and gray
She might close her eyes and sit, rocking gently for a bit
Till all the bad thoughts go away

Back when children played their games
London Bridge and Jesse James
She captured flags, she bounced the ball
And every time, she beat them all

And now she comes home to a cat in a three-room walk-up flat
And plays a game of solitaire
Well she made a fist last night, and she broke the hallway light
And the pieces scattered everywhere

It looks like it cost you too
And that car you're driving

Well you don't look familiar
Are you new in town
Here's a local girl
Who wants to show you around
How do

Where'd you get that accent son
It matches your cowboy boots
Tonight those lone star ladies
Must be lonesome and oh so blue
'Cause we're a thousand miles
From the Texas line
And if you've no objection son
Tonight you're mine
How do

Well I've been to Paris baby
I've been to Dallas too
But I didn't see no one there

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Well I know it ain't been roses lately, baby, it's just been thorns
And no matter what we do, nothing seems to change
Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong

To one Faded Love on the jukebox tonight 
You slide in your coins 
And the music keeps playing 
A slow country dance 
On a Saturday night

Sweethearts in love and others just lonely 
Searching for someone to waltz with tonight 
In a smoky old bar you know that it's only 
A slow country dance 
On a Saturday night

And love's never easy or ever as true 
When the changing of partners 
Is no longer new 
You lead with your heart and closing your eyes 
Dance just to dance 
In three-quarter time

Down at the bar a woman tells stories 
Batting her eyes to someone not there 
Her glass is half full or maybe half empty 
Like the jokes told about her 
When they think she can't hear

And now the perfume is cheap and the makeup is careless 
And the dress out of fashion for a woman her age 
But she don't give a damn for those who would cherish 
A much lighter step and a much younger face

And love's never easy or ever as true 
When the changing of partners 
Is no longer new

Something of a fool
Something of a heartbreak

And she used to feel him in the wind
His warm breath upon her neck
And goosebumps up and down her skin

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"This shirt is old and faded
All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history
I wear it now for Sunday chores
Cleaning house and raking leaves
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Late one night when the wind was still
Daddy brought the baby to the window sill
To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
The one and only time daddy saw it fly

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
The neighbors had a party on their porch
Daddy rocked the baby, mother said amen
When Halley came to visit in 1910

Now, back then Jackson was a real small town
And it's not every night a comet comes around
It was almost eighty years since its last time through
So I bet your mother would have said amen too

As its tail stretched out like a stardust streak
The papers wrote about it every day for a week
You wondered where it's going and where it's been
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

Now daddy told the baby sleeping in his arms
To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
And he made a little wish as she slept so sound
In 1986 that wish came 'round

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
She saw it in the sky from her daddy's porch
As heavenly sent as it was back then
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

And late one night when the wind was still",Halley Came to Jackson,1990

Her sisters ask about her beau
Her dad inquires, how's business been

She's kind of tense around the shoulders

She counts the days 'til they promote her

She'll take a weekend now and then
To stay in bed and watch the reruns
She'll turn the phone off when guilt sets in
But Sunday always kinda leaves her let down

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can read your eyes just like a book
You tell me different, but I know that look
And I don't have to guess what's between the lines

So what in the world am I still doing here
You push me away when I get too near
Saying love's too simple to analyze

So why do I feel confused
Why do I feel so used
Like a worn-out thought you threw away
It wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say

Where are the windows, where are the doors?
I haven't the key to your heart anymore
I haven't a clue to what's gone wrong

'Cause you look at me sometimes as if I weren't there
You say you're listening, but you never hear
The strains of silence have grown so strong

I never wanted to doubt you
But I'd be better off without you
I'm no good at looking the other way
It wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say

So look at me one last time
With eyes that still know how to shine
Hold me like you won't let go
But you let go anyway

No one belongs where they're not wanted
You're just a ghost, and my heart is haunted
When I said goodbye, you didn't even beg me to stay
It wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say
No baby, it wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say
",What You Didn't Say,1990
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"She threw her purse upon the bed
She looked around and shook her head
There's really nothing left, she said
There's nothing I ain't done
She wore your favorite dress tonight
She hoped her hair would catch the light
And you just sat there gettin' tight
On double shots of rum

You don't care what people say
They're gonna say it anyway
You don't hear what you can't use
It's always been the same old news
You don't beg and you don't plead
Or miss a thing that you don't need
She knew by the way you kissed her
When she's gone, you won't miss her

Morning comes on an old cat's paws
And when the sun hits the walls
The light's as bright as it ever was
After or before
And you wince as waking pounds your head
And you drag your arm across the bed
And the tangled sheets and the twisted spread
Fall onto the floor

And the kitchen table finds you silent
If you had a thought, now you can't find it
You take a long drag on your smoke
And taste your coffee growing cold
She didn't beg and you didn't plead
She knew exactly how to leave
The way she knew when you kissed her
When she's gone, you won't miss her

She didn't beg and you didn't plead

The way she knew as you kissed her
When she's gone, you won't miss her

In the middle of God knows where
I got one quarter left your machine packs up
But baby I know you're there

And I just start crying ?cause it makes no sense
To waste these words and twenty-five cents
On a losing game
Baby you win again

I've been turning it over and over again
Like a stone I'm waiting to wish on
I've been holding my breath just wondering when
You'll make some sort of decision
To let me in or let me go
I'll always lose if I never know
Where I fit in
Baby you win again

I can't be right if I'm always wrong
I can't stand up if I'm always kneeling
At your altar or at your throne
You could show just a little feeling
For who I am
Baby you win again

Last night I dreamed we were standing here
On the corner of love and heartache
You jumped into your car you found first gear
And baby I felt the earth shake
And I woke up trembling with my heart in my throat
'Cause there's never a look a word or a note
At the bitter end
Baby you win again

I can't be right if I'm always wrong
I can't stand up if I'm always kneeling

By your bed we'll leave a light

Your eyes are tired when day is done

On your way to dreamland

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
And show that things that drew me to you and stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you
Our hearts are beating while we sleep, but while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when and the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us when fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling, not by luck, but by never turning back
Some will call on destiny, but I just call on faith
That the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, to what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives, there's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes; you're searching for that field of clover
So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given and the other one we make
And the world won't stop, and actions speak louder

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I took a walk in the rain one day 
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rail 'til I saw that train 
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I can not disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me
 
I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
 
I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette
 
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
 
I've crossed lines of words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh 
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
I'll play from either side

I can see with both eyes closed in the dark
Sleep will come in just a while but till it does I choose
To listen to the rain, it's the rhythm of the blues

I walk along these streets of home that once belonged to us
And now baby I walk alone and I am lost
In the sound of my own footsteps on the avenues
I guess I'm only walking to rhythm of the blues

I don't wanna hear another word spoken, I don't wanna see another tear shed
I can't seem to fix what's broken, like this record baby in my head

Lonely looks as bad on me as lonely looks on you
And still we keep on moving to the rhythm of the blues

I want a place to call my own, where you have never been
I wanna look around and know you won't be coming back again
On some pretense paper-thin that I can see right through

That's the place that once it starts, no amount of tears can put out
I know you're scared, but no one's spared when you play with matches

You got me walking through fire

Maybe you've been burned by lovers, maybe you've been scarred by the pain
But baby, I'm not like the others, drawing moths to a flame
Spite is like a spark, crackling in the dark, consuming all it catches
And you got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire to get to you
Got me walking through fire (walking through fire)
You got me walking through fire (walking through fire)

You can see the toll it's taking, you can feel the faith it's shaking
You can hear the heart it's breaking now

Baby, I've been burned by the fever, I've been scorched by desire
But baby, I am not your deceiver or your eloquent liar
Your jealous heart is tearing us apart, turning love to ashes

You've got me walking through fire to get to you
Got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire

She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of countin' sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep

All she ever talked about was gettin' on to ride
She was livin' in another time you could see it in her eyes
Everyday after school she'd head don't to the tracks
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back

When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true

There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust

Said she was just a little girl actin' kinda strange

When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true

Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime

And those who search for treasure, they must live on grander dreams

We rose and fell just like the tides, he filled my heart and soul and I
Buried all my dreams for someone else to find in my pirate days

You knew the groan of every stair 
All the walls seemed to listen in 
All the years seemed to take up air 
And when you dreamed, it was of the wind blowing cold and hard 
And in those dreams you thought you lived in a house of cards 

And I grew up in a town like this 
You knew the names of every street 
On the surface it looked so safe 
But it was perilous underneath 
That's the place where you shoved your doubts
And hid your ugly scars
God forbid if word got out
About your house of cards 

And now I feel the wind about to blow 
Baby, I'm so scared 
We're repeating the past instead of letting it go 
And I don't want to go back there

Afraid to move or else

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I was standing on this sidewalk
In 1945 in Jacksonville, Illinois 
When asked what my name was there came no reply 
They said I was a deaf and sightless, half-wit boy 

But Lewis was my name though I could not say it 
I was born and raised in New Orleans 
My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it 
On a barge and a prayer upstream

They searched for a mother and they searched for a father 
And they searched till they searched no more 
The doctors put to rest their scientific test 
And they named me John Doe No. 24 

And they all shook their heads in pity 
For a world so silent and dark 
Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery 
But so too is the human heart

And it was my heart's own perfume
When the crape jasmine bloomed on St. Charles Avenue 
Though I couldn't hear the bells of the streetcars coming 
By toeing the track I knew 

And if I were an old man returning 
With my satchel and pork-pie hat 
I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon 
And I'd hit every one on Basin after that

The years kept passing as they passed me around 
From one state ward to another 
Like I was an orphaned shoe from the lost and found 
Always missing the other

They gave me a harp last Christmas 
And all the nurses took a dance 
Lately I've been growing listless 
Been dreaming again of the past

I'm wandering down to the banks of the Great Big Muddy 
Where the shotgun houses stand 
I am seven years old and I feel my daddy 
Reach out for my hand
 
While I drew breath no one missed me

And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see

That you haven't been able to come to the table

Even though your home is right here

Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered

On those golden wedding bands wrapped around their fingers 
By the time I turn away I feel it once again 
I'm back in this familiar place, outside looking in

And all the words we grasped at they just fell away 
I kept waiting on forgiveness to fix the broken places 
But nothing even like it ever came my way

I took a turn and then I found this old house coming toward me 
I heard the sound a heart must make when a memory's caving in 
Oh, baby, what a hungry place, outside looking in

It's the hardest kind of need that never knows a reason 
Are we such a lonely breed or just born in a lonely season?

Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices
Under teacher's watchful eye
We learned about the world around us
At our desks and at dinner time
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town
His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer 
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
Flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing
The starving children have been replaced 
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet
We pencil in we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold 
We doctor the receipt

And the stones in the road
They fly out from beneath our wheels

Leave a mark whence they came

If I hadn't known about you
You said everyone can be a rock-'n'-roll like a river too

Well, something happens when you find someone
Who makes you feel like you can do no wrong
No, you don't have to take the whole world on
Just be tender when you want be

And I never would have known it, baby
If I hadn't known about you
You said everyone can be a rock-'n'-roll like a river too

So let the waters carry us away
Wave goodbye to the old parade
Baby, when we're unafraid
To be tender when we want to be

All the waters wash our cares away
All that we can see are better days
Don't ever let me hesitate

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"If you ever need to hear a voice
In the middle of the night 
When it seems so black outside
That you can't remember light 
Ever shone on you or the ones you love
In this or another lifetime

And the voice you need to hear
Is the true and the trusted kind
With a soft, familiar rhythm
In these swirling, unsure times
When the waves are lapping in
And you're not sure you can swim 
Well, here's the lifeline

If you ever need to feel a hand
Take up your own 
When you least expect
But want it more than you've ever known 
Baby, here's that hand
And, baby, here's my voice that's calling
This is love, all it ever was and will be 
This is love 

And if you ever need some proof
That time can heal your wounds 
Just step inside my heart
And walk around these rooms 
Where the shadows used to be
You can feel as well as see
How peace con hover 
Now time's been here to fix
What's broken with its power 
The love that smashed us both to bits
Spent its last few hours 
Calling out your name
I thought this is the kind of pain 
From which we don't recover 

But I'm standing here now
With my heart held out to you 
You would've thought a miracle
Was all that got us through 
Well, baby, all I know
All I know is I'm still standing 
And this is love, all it ever was and will be 
This is love 

And I see you still
And there's this catch in my throat
And I just swallow hard till it leaves me 
There's nothing in this world 
That can change what we know 
Still I know I am here if you ever need me 
And this is love 

And if you ever think of me
Let it be around twilight 
When the world has settled down
And the last round of sunlight 
Is waning in the sky
As you sit and watch the night descending 
A car will pass out front
With lovers at the wheel 
A dog will bark out back
Ad children's voices peal 
Over and under the air
You've been there lost in the remembering 
And if you ever wish for things
That are only in the past 
Just remember that the wrong things
Aren't supposed to last 
Babe, it's over and done
And the rest is gonna come when you let it

And this is love, all that it ever was and will be 
This is love, when you let it, if you let it now 
This is love, all it ever was and can be 
This is love",This Is Love,1994
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Baby, where's that place where time stands still?
I remember like a lover can
But I forget it like a leaver will

It's no place you can get to by yourself
You've got to love someone and they love you
Time will stop for nothing else

And memory plays tricks on us
The more we cling, the less we trust
And the less we trust, the more we hurt
And as time goes on, it just gets worse

So, baby, where's that place where time stood still?
It is under glass inside a frame
Was it over when you had your fill

And here we are with nothing
But this emptiness inside of us
Your smile a fitting, final gesture
Wish I could have loved you better

Baby, where's that place where time stands still?
I remember like a lover can
But I forget it like a leaver will

It's the first time that you held my had
It's the smell and the taste and the fear and the thrill
It's everything I understand
And all the things I never will",Where Time Stands Still,1994
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"In this world there's a whole lot of trouble, baby 
In this world there's a whole lot of pain 
In this world there's a whole lot of trouble, but 
A whole lot of ground to gain 
Why take when you could be giving?
Why watch as the world goes by?
It's a hard enough life to be living 
Why walk when you can fly?

In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow 
In this world there's a whole lot of shame 
In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow 
And a whole lot of ground to gain 
When you spend your whole life wishing 
Wanting, and wondering why 
It's a long enough life to be living 
Why walk when you can fly?

And in this world there's a whole lot of golden 
In this world there's a whole lot of pain 
In this world you've a soul for a compass 
And a heart for a pair of wings

Rising bright in an azure sky 
For the rest of the time that you're given

Here comes your ghost again 
But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full 
And you happened to call 
And here I sit 
Hand on the telephone 
Hearing a voice I'd known 
A couple of light years ago 
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes 
Were bluer than robin's eggs 
My poetry was lousy you said 
Where are you calling from? 
A booth in the midwest 
Ten years ago 
I bought you some cufflinks 
You brought me something 
We both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene 
Already a legend 
The unwashed phenomenon 
The original vagabond 
You strayed into my arms 
And there you stayed 
Temporarily lost at sea 
The Madonna was yours for free 
Yes the girl on the half-shell 
Could keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing 
With brown leaves falling all around 
And snow in your hair 
Now you're smiling out the window 
Of that crummy hotel 
Over Washington Square 
Our breath comes out white clouds 
Mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me 
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me 
You're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You who are so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
'Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly 
Yes I loved you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust 
I've already paid",Diamonds & Rust,1995
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"When we were young we pledged allegiance
Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices
Under teacher's watchful eye
We learned about the world around us
At our desks and at dinner time
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town
His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer 
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
Flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing
The starving children have been replaced 
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet
We pencil in we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold 
We doctor the receipt

And the stones in the road
They fly out from beneath our wheels
Another day, another deal
Before we get back home

Stones in the road
Leave a mark whence they came
A thousands points of light or shame
Baby, I don't know",Stones in the Road [*/#][#],1995

Tumbling and falling down the avalanche, ooh

So be quiet tonight

But I will raise my voice into the void
You have left me nowhere to go

I love you so much and it's so bizarre
A mystery that goes on and on and on 
This is the best thing and the very most hard
And we don't get along

After countless appeals
We keep spinning our wheels
On this mountain of new fallen snow
So I let go the catch and we are over the edge
You have left me nowhere to go

I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche

And I'm always at the airport when my ship is coming in

Fourth of July

Better knock on wood
It never felt so good

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We were born during the boom times
Played house down in the bomb shelter
Suffered through the wonder years
And silence at the dinner hour

But once upon a summertime
Out behind the old garage
We were buzzing on midnight
Luckys and Rolling Rock

Thinking we were heroes in our own hometown
Nothing less than heroes in that old hometown

Some married on a day in June
Some disappeared without a trace
And some of us are still at large
Still searching for a better place

But once upon another time
It didn't matter what they said
Didn't matter if we fell behind
We'd still come out ahead

'Cause we believed in heroes in that old hometown
Hey, you could be a hero in your own hometown

Now I'm long away and very far
From gazing at an evening sky
From wishing on a shooting star
From thinking that a heart can't lie

This world is gonna wear you thin
Knot you up and spin you round
This world will take its aim, call you every name
Trying to bring you down

Everything seems so clear 
When you're looking back from such a distance
When the road not taken disappears
Into the path of least resistance

But once upon a time oh-so long ago
Underneath this same old sky, every brand new road

Would know that we were heroes in our own hometown
Nothing less than heroes in that old hometown

And suddenly you're there walking with somebody else
I can see it now, what's right up ahead
A scene I've played a thousand times over in my head

I can see it now; it isn't just a dream
Can't shake myself awake, can't fall right back to sleep
Face to face I come right up to the truth
I can see it now; I'm still not over you

I can hear it now, your voice saying my name
It's too late for me to walk the other way
I can hear it now, asking how I've been
Oh, and by the way have you met my friend?

I can hear it now, a breaking all apart
A strange familiar sound that's coming from my heart
Feeling just as bad as the day that it was new
I can see it now; I'm still not over you

When you're out of sight, baby, you're still on my mind
You're much too hard to lose, you're too easy to find
Like a bottle to a drunk, like trouble to a fool
I've only ever seen just what I've wanted to

I can feel it now as you walk away
Something left unsaid and the nothing left to say
I can feel it now like weather in my bones
Before it even comes, before I even know

I want to be the one that you can't get enough of

You used to be just this guy I knew from that same old scene

Been hands in my pockets, coat collar up, thinking 'bout you

Now some lovers are apart, but they're never far away
I can see her in your eyes, hear her in your voice, and I have to turn away
Oh, what covet is to ache, is what aching is to me
For the arms of a man who knows who I am and where I need to be

And if I know what I know, then the lonely can't pretend
When you look at me, baby, my god, how I feel so whole again
Is there heaven after all, or just this empty space
That no amount of time, nor comfort in its hands can ever help me face?
Which is worse is yet to come, your rebuff or my resign
Hey, when you look at me, baby, I'm helpless as a child, naked to the eye

It's like a fever and a spell, unbroken by a sigh
Oh, when you look at me, baby, I'm going nowhere, just naked to the eye

Could be right before your very eyes
Just beyond a door that's open wide
Could be far away or in your own backyard
There are those who say you can look too hard
For your place in the world

A few false starts gonna make you stronger
When I'm sure I've finally found it
Gonna wrap these arms all around it

They just find us when we're there to find

That someone somewhere feels you've earned

Some people have never been the lonely kind
Never called a friend in the middle of the night
Just to hear a voice say it's okay
And now I hear you speak each and every word

And a breeze in Tuscany please

What if we spent all of our days
Improving our minds, learning new ways to be lazy
It wouldn't be too much of a strain
Relax after breakfast till lunch comes around
Can't wait for dinner; oh, I need to lie down
And refuel out by the pool

What if the ancients were lazy like us
Too blissed-out to paint, to sketch, or to sculpt
Just as relaxed as the tower of Pisa
Not ever missing that old Mona Lisa

What if we never got back on the plane
As summer turned colder and then warmer again
Losing all track of the passing of years
Till it no longer mattered how long we'd been here

What if we went to Italy

I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.

You think about today 'cause the past is just the past

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

Another round of blues
Several miles ago

On a lost highway

You better take care of me
This time
If you're gonna go
Remember me and all

We had our bitter cheer
And sweet sorrow
We lost a lot today
We'll get it back tomorrow

I know the rainbow's end
I see lights in a fat city
I feel love again

If you're gonna go, go

Something so real, so real
All this time
I been a face in the crowd
Now I'm living in color
And laughing out loud
All these names
For just fooling around
It's a new breakthrough
It's an old breakdown

We smoked a lot of hope
We did our cryin' too
We're finally waking up
To what real love can do
Oh, down a lost highway
Under the twilight moon

You were looking straight at me
From an ancient photograph
Stuck between letters and some keys

There's no such thing as no regrets

I gonna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio,
And I swore someday I was gonna go
Down a highway 10 past Lafayett
There's a Baton Rouge and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets
'Cause I'm never gonna come back home

When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
Hey
 
They gotta alligator stew and a crawfish pie,
A gulf storm blowin' into town tonight
Livin' on the delta it's quite a show
They got hurricane parties ev'ry time it blows?
But here up north it's a cold, cold rain,
And there ain't no cure for my blues today 
Except when the paper says Beousoleil is a comin' into town

When they play you a waltz form a nineteen ten,

You learn to swing with do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais so do?

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
And show that things that drew me to you and stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you

Our hearts are beating while we sleep, but while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop, actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when and the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us when fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling, not by luck
But by never turning back, no turning back

Some will call on destiny, but I just call on faith
'Cause the world won't stop, actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, to what your heart might say
Everything you got, you got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives, there's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes
You're searching for that field of clover

So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a great big light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given and the other one we make

And the world won't stop, actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart will say
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Because the world won't stop

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I took a walk in the rain one day on the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate

And for them I would not disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I take my chances, I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat

He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And threw away my cigarettes

I take my chances, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get

I've crossed lines of words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out
And I've been on fire and the tears are mine to weep

Now I can cry until I laugh and laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half, I'll play from either side

I take my chances, I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances, I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances

I take my chances

Chase that fleet sweet bird of youth
Grow up sweetly, grow up strong
Hear the heartbeat, in my song

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The stars are out tonight
The breeze is warm and light
As I'm walking right back to you
Along the dreaming road, the only way to go
When I'm traveling by our code, that north is true
Once upon a time these same bright stars did shine
Down the center line leading here
Nearly thirty years ago
Now the map is stained and old
But on the dreaming road the coast is clear
I loved you more than life and I guess that's why I died
When you would not love me back, I couldn't survive
And so the girl I was turned into someone else
Keeping to myself and from the light
I wasn't odd or strange, just quietly rearranged
Sometimes the biggest change stays out of sight

So without plot or clue I ran away from you
I was twenty-two and drunk in Amsterdam
Got robbed in Paris, France
Got home on one last chance
And without a backward glance I began again
And the days just kept on rolling and I just kept on going
Without a thought of ever slowing down
I made this long road mine
But it was not the dreaming kind
Too many lost souls trying to get found
But beneath this ancient sky
One night we did collide
And the hole I thought was sealed opened wide
I tried so hard again not to fall back in
But you had me then by the throat
And a strange serenity came washing over me
Almost peacefully I felt the rope

A million miles goes by in the blink of an eye
And so I cannot try to slow time down
And years are made of sand slipping through my hands
Even faster than the speed of sound
The stars are out tonight
The breeze is soft and light
As I'm walking right back to you
With nothing left to hide, the tears have all been cried
And the girl who died is walking too
Down the dreaming road, where the light is always gold
The air is never cold and always fine
And north is always true and you are always you
And I'm that girl you knew once upon a time",The Dreaming Road,2001
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"You could be this man; he's got it all worked out
To the nth degree, no fears, no doubts
He'll retire at thirty to his big-ass house
Next to the putting green

Now he's got a picture in his head of the perfect wife
Their perfect children, their perfect life
Nothing wrong with that
Coming home each night to his cul-de-sac of dreams

Funny now how it all went by so fast
One day he's looking over his shoulder at the past
When everybody had to go, had to be, had to get somewhere
How did he forget about what got him there?

Now you could be this woman; she's the CEO
She's got her power suits and her IPOs
She punched a hole in the ceiling years ago
And she hasn't pulled back since

Now there's a gardener for the flowers
A cook for the meals, a maid for the laundry
An accountant for the bills, a walker for the dog 
And a trainer when she feels the need to lose an inch

Funny now how it all went by so fast
One day she's looking over her shoulder at the past
When everybody had to go, had to be, had to get somewhere
Somehow she forgot about what got her there

Or you could be the one who takes the long way home

Make a joyful noise, swim naked at night
Read a poem a day, call in well sometimes and
Laugh when they believe it

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Oh, the people would come from far away,
To dance all night to the break of day.
When the caller would holler: ""Do Si Do"",
They knew Uncle Pen was ready to go.
Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

Well, he played an old tune they called the ""Soldier's Joy"",
And he played the one they called the ""Boston Boy"".
Greatest of all was the ""Jennie Lynn"",
To me, that's where the fiddlin' begins.

Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away,
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow,
And he knew it was time for him to go.

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I'm a town in Carolina, I'm a detour on a ride
For a phone call and a soda, I'm a blur from the driver's side
I'm the last gas for an hour if you're going twenty-five
I am Texaco and tobacco, I am dust you leave behind

I am peaches in September, and corn from a roadside stall
I'm the language of the natives, I'm a cadence and a drawl
I'm the pines behind the graveyard, and the cool beneath their shade
Where the boys have left their beer cans
I am weeds between the graves.

My porches sag and lean with old black men and children
My sleep is filled with dreams, I never can fulfill them
I am a town.

I am a church beside the highway where the ditches never drain
I'm a Baptist like my daddy, and Jesus knows my name
I am memory and stillness, I am lonely in old age
I am not your destination, I am clinging to my ways
I am a town.

I'm a town in Carolina, I am billboards in the fields
I'm an old truck up on cinder blocks, missing all my wheels
I am Pabst Blue Ribbon, American, and ""Southern Serves the South""
I am tucked behind a Jaycees sign, on the rural route
I am a town

How will we laugh just like before
When there's water rising up to our door
And we may never see each other again
My dear old friend

Will there be someone to remember
A little place that we loved
How the music played all night and day
Through the windows up above

How the birds sang in the morning
How the dog barked in the yard

Wondering what might have been
Old regrets and chances missed
Borne away on some lambent wind

The job's okay, so it doesn't inspire
Thoughts of leaving it all behind
You used to have dreams of settin' the world on fire
All you want now is peace of mind

And a beautiful racket an' whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet between the truces and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And all of the wisdom between a smile and a tear

Do your dreaming in traffic jams
You do your running in shopping malls
You do your breathing the best you can
Between car pools and cell phone calls

Who cares, you'll never live in Paris
So what, you'll never travel by Lear
How do some of us learn what matters
While others never get to hear

Such a beautiful racket an' whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet between the truces and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And all of the wisdom between a smile and a tear

Hold on
Hold on

So your day will end like this
Turning slowly down your street
Silent worlds of kitchens lit
Front yards full of fallen leaves

Trees are bare, the garden's done
Another season gone to earth
Before you blink a new one comes
Reminding you what the old one's worth

And a beautiful racket comes in whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet between the roses and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And [Incomprehensible] wisdom [Incomprehensible]

Such a beautiful racket
Such a beautiful racket, hold on
Such a beautiful racket, hold on

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Tonight the moon came up, it was nearly full
Way down here on earth, I could feel it's pull
The weight of gravity or just the lure of life
Made me want to leave my only home tonight

Now I'm just wonderin' how we know where we belong
Is it in a photograph or a dashboard poet's song?
Will I have missed my chance to right some ancient wrong
Should I find myself between here and gone?

Now I could grab my keys, clear out in my truck
With every cent on board bringing me their luck
An' I could drive too fast like a midnight sleeve
As if there was a way to outrun the grief

Now I'm just wonderin' how we know where we belong
In a song that's left behind, in the dream I couldn't wake from
Could I've felt the brush of a soul that's passing on
Somewhere in between, here and gone?

Up above me, wayward angels
A blur of wings and grace
One for courage, one for safety
One for just in case

I thought a light went out but now the candle shines
I thought my tears wouldn't stop then I dried my eyes
And after all of this, the truth that holds me here
Is that this emptiness is something not to fear

Yeah, I'll keep wondering how we know where we belong
After all the journey's made and the journey's yet to come
When I feel like giving up instead of going on
Somewhere in between

Yeah, I'm just wondering how we know where we belong
Is it in the arc of the moon leaving shadows on the lawn?
In the path of fireflies and a single bird at dawn

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I don't really know how I got here this time
I was only just following orders
Listening to the voice in my mind
Saying steer clear of margins and borders

So I wasn't thinking of where we would go
On a could afternoon through the mountains we drove
Up a few hairpin turns and then spread out below
The valley appeared with the sun like Elysium

I looked out the window and stared at the fields
Where the blue sky and green were colliding
I looked back at you and I knew we were sealed
By a fate that has ways of providing

Yes, sometimes you get there in spite of the route
Losing track of your life and what it's about
The road seems to know when to straighten right out
The closer you come to Elysium

They say there's a place for those who are good
With it's pearly gates swinging wide open
The rest of us here are just knocking on wood
Quietly, piously hoping

I could wonder if all of it led me to you
I could show you the arrows and circles I drew
I didn't have a map, it's the best I could do
On the fly and on the run

To dreams that were tethered like kites to the ground
To the bridges I burned, to then turning around
It was here in your heart I was finally found
And the last battle won for Elysium

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Girls like me aren't hard to find
We grow like roses on the vine
We wear our hearts on our sleeves
You probably know a girl like me

We live alone and in our heads
We eat standing up or in our beds
Guilt and fear merge easily
In the quiet souls of girls like me

And loneliness is like a cold
Common and no cure we're told
We take to bed per chance to dream
In the blue light of the TV screen

Girls like me like summer light
And cold beer on a summer night
And boys who aren't afraid of what they see
Inside the eyes of girls like me

And hopefulness is like a drug
It makes a girl believe in love
And if somehow you love us back
We think there's something wrong with that

Girls like me aren't hard to trust
Your deepest secrets safe with us
And when it's time we set you free
You can always count on girls like me

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I'm standing at a traffic light somewhere in West L.A.
Waiting for the sign to change then I'll be on my way
The noise, the heat, the crush of cars just robs me of my nerve
And someone yells and blasts their horn and pins me to the curb

I'm a stranger here, no one you would know
My ship has not come in but I keep hoping though
And I keep looking past, the sun that sets above
Saying to myself, goodnight America

And I'm driving into Houston on a rain slicked Texas road
Land so flat and sky so dark, I say a prayer to float
Should all at once the Sanasito surge beyond it's banks
Like Noah reaching higher ground I'd offer up my thanks

'Cause I'm a stranger here, no one you would know
I'm just passing through, I am therefore I go
The moon rose in the east but now it's right above
As I say aloud, goodnight America

Midnight, it's hard to see the stars
Out on a highway near Atlanta
Full of strip malls and used cars

First light just roll your window down
And smell the salty air
Perfume of Charleston Town

I'm looking with a pilgrim's eyes upon some promised land
And dreaming with my heart outstretched as if it were my hand
And I'll hit the cross Bronx just in time to beat the rush hour lock
I have no clue what time it is from this world's busted clock

I'm a stranger here, no one you would know
I'm from somewhere else, well, isn't everybody though?
I don't know where I'll be when the sun comes up
Until then sweet dreams, goodnight America",Goodnight America,2004
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Got my work clothes on for love, sweat and dirt
All this holy dust upon my face an' shirt
Headin' uptown now, just as the shifts are changin'
To Grand Central Station

I've got my lunch box, got my hard hat in my hand
I ain't no hero, mister, just a workin' man
An' all these voices keep on askin' me to take them
To Grand Central Station, Grand Central Station

Wanna stand beneath the clock just one more time
Wanna wait upon the platform for the Hudson line
I guess you're never really all alone or too far from
The pull of home an' the stars upon that painted dome still shine

I paid my way out on the 42nd Street
I lit a cigarette and stared down at my feet
Imagined all the ones that ever stood here waitin'
At Grand Central Station, Grand Central Station

And now Hercules is starin' down at me
Next to him's Minerva and Mercury
Well, I nod to them and start my crawl
Flyers coverin' every wall, faces of the missing are all I see

Tomorrow, I'll be back there, workin' on the pile
Going in, comin' out, single file
Before my job is done there's one more trip I'm makin'

Nothing hurts and nothing aches

Looking down at the world below
A bunch of whining, fighting schmo's
Up here we've got none of those

There's pools and lakes and hills and mountains
Music, art, and lighted fountains
Who needs bucks here, no one's counting

No one works, we all just play
You can pick the weather everyday
If you change your mind, that's okay

Grandma's up here, Grandpa too
In a condo with to-die-for views
There's presidents and movie stars
You just come as you are

No one's lost and no one's missing
No more parting just hugs and kissing
And all these stars are just for wishing
In my heaven

There's little white lights everywhere
Your childhood dog in dad's old chair
And more memories than my heart can hold
When Eva's singing 'Fields of Gold'

There's neighbors, thieves and long lost lovers
Villains, poets, kings and mothers
Up here we forgive each other
In my heaven

For every soul that's down there waiting
Holding on, still hesitating
We say a prayer of levitating
In my heaven

But it can't matter what you're not
By the time you're here, we're all we've got

Now read the signs, obey the lines,

Some cigarette butts.

Not need very much.

Thousand stars above you.
And at a roadside stop, 
You call to talk to a voice 
Back home that swears they love you. 
But at the sound of the tone you 
Hang up the phone 
And peel out of that joint. 
You try again, God knows when, 
At least they got the point: 
They lost you to the open road.

Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star

On a dark lonesome highway that finds you instead
So certain it knows you, you can't turn away
Something or someone has found you today

Genius to Jesus, maybe He saved us
But who would believe us, I can't really say
Whatever the calling, the stumbling or falling
You follow it knowing there's no other way, there's no other way

They're Zealots and preachers and readers of dreams
The righteous gel out of stand, the safe drives to sin
The lonely and lost are just waiting to hear
Any moment their purpose will be perfectly clear

And then life would mean more, than their name on their door
And that far distant shore that's so near
They'd hear the calling, the stumbling and falling
They'd follow it knowing there's nothing to fear, nothing to fear

I don't remember a voice on a dark lonesome road
When I started the journey so long ago
I was only just trying to outrun the norms
There was never a question of having a choice

Closer and closer apart

And now all the kings horses and all the kings men
Wait for their clarion call
Pride hears its voice and fear wins again

So on with the song, I don't give a damn
",On with the Song,2007
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Let's go down to the fields tonight
Where the grass grows 'round our knees
Lay down in the silver light
Tripping through the trees

Broken hallow in my hand
The distance in your eyes
The path's just gone, good luck so long
Cross ourselves and hope to fly

No road maps, no signposts
No north star, no lifeboats
No cavalry coming in sight
But we're alright

Let's feel small in the world tonight
Beneath the giant sky
Forget for once who's wrong or right
Just let it all go by

Close our eyes when we grow tired
And dream of where we'll be
And night gives way to another day
Have we ever woken up this free?

No road maps, no signposts
No north star, no lifeboats
No miracles coming in sight
But we're alright

I never had a talisman
I never wore a charm
But it's not too late to believe that fate
Was always keeping us from harm

No road map, no signpost
No north star, no life boats
No miracles coming in sight

No voices to guide us
No angels beside us
No [Incomprehensible], no mystical lights
We're alright

No omens, no compass
No Seir, no prophet
No cavalry coming in sight
But we're alright
But we're alright

We're alright
We're alright

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We believe in things that we cannot see
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

And we believe in peace within every heart
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Burning brightly, brightly in the dark
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

So come on darling, feel your spirits rise
Come on children, open up your eyes
God is all around, Buddha's us at the gate
Allah hears your prayers, it's not too late

And we believe in things that will give us hope
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Let your voice be heard, celebrate your voice
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

So come on darling, feel your spirits rise
Come on children, open up your eyes
God is all around, Buddha's at the gate
Allah hears your prayers it's not too late

We believe in things that make us all the same
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Love belongs to all, in deed and aim
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

And we believe in things that can't be done
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?
Lift up your heart, put down your gun
Why shouldn't we? Why shouldn't we?

We believe in things we're told that we can't change
Why shouldn't we?
We had heroes once and we will again
Why shouldn't we?

So come on darling
Come on children
God is all around, Buddha's at the gate

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Maybe love is all anybody ever should believe in
Maybe life is just something that employs us till we die
Maybe all we know is that the sun will come up every morning
Maybe time can choose whether to be earth bound or to fly

Everybody thinks they've got it down
I won't worry, the truth's always been found
In your life story

Maybe you're the one waiting for the ship to find your harbor
Maybe you're the one looking past the forest to the trees
Maybe you still think, the older that you get life just gets harder
Maybe you would trade everything for just one moments peace

Everybody's trained to hear the sound
Of their hearts calling now, you can write yours down
It's your life story

Gather up your telegrams, your faded pictures, best laid plans
Work some postcards, 40 files, every sunset in the sky
Carry with you maps and string flashlights, friends will make you sing at
And stars to help you find your place, music, hope and amazing grace

Maybe what we live is nothing but a tangled little mystery
Maybe what we take is nothing that has ever had a name
Maybe love will fade, like the parchment pages of our history
Maybe life is made that flickers from some brilliant burnish flame

Everybody's waiting for a sign
I won't worry, I think we'll be just fine
In your life story, it's your life story
In my life story, this is our life story
In your life story

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Take me to the night
I'm tippin' topsy-turvy, turnin' upside down
Hold me tight and whisper what you wish
For there is no one here around
Oh, you may sing-song me sweet smiles
Regardless of the city's careless frown

Come watch the no colors fade blazin'
Into petal sprays of violets of dawn

In blindfold wonderments, enchantments
You can lift my wings softly to fly
Your eyes are like swift fingers reachin' out
Into the pockets of my night
Whirlin', twirlin' puppy warm
Before the flashin' cloaks of darkness gone

Come see the no colors fade blazin'
Into petal sprays of violets of dawn

Some Prince Charmin', I'll be on two white steeds
To bring you dapple diamond crowns
And climb your tower, Sleepin' Beauty
'Fore you ever know I've left the ground
You can wear a Cinderella, Snow-white
Alice Wonderland gown

Come watch the no colors fade blazin'
Into petal sprays of violets of dawn

But if I seem to wander off in dream-like looks
Please, let me settle slowly
It's only me just starin', speakin' holy
No, I don't mean to wake you up
It's only loneliness just comin' on

So let the no colors fade blazin'
Into petal sprays of violets of dawn

Like shadows burstin' into mist
Behind the echoes of this nonsense song
It's just chasin', whisperin' trail
Of secret steps; see them laughin' on
There's magic in the sleepiness
Of wakin' to a childish soundin' yawn

Come watch the no colors fade blazin'
Into petal sprays of violets of dawn",Violets of Dawn,2009
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The dust settles after a hit and run 
Bewildered by the damage done 
I don't know why we chose the roads we travel 
Or how a life could get so unraveled 

[Chorus: x2]
We live our lives from then until now 
By the mercy received and the marks on our brow 
To my heart I'll collect what the four winds will scatter 
And frame my life into before and after 
Once a trick of light made me believe 
A red fire was blazing from every tree 
We held hands as the evening gathered 
I forgave myself for what I didn't ask her 
I once saw the sky filled with falling stars 
Bumped my head in the dark and it left a scar 
Held on too tight before I let it go 
Then forgave myself for what I didn't know 

I've stretched my soul over fifty states 
I have lived on fumes and religious cornflakes 
And once I dreamt my shoe had grown thin and battered 
And forgave myself for what didn't matter 
God said Cain where is your brother 
And who will tell his grieving mother 
Jacob dreamt an angel called his name 
And he never was quite the same 

[Chorus]",Before and After,2010
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I've never had a way with women, but the hills of iowa make me wish that I could,
And I've never found a way to say I love you, but if the chance came by, oh I, I would,
But way back where I come from, we never mean to bother,
We don't like to make our passions other peoples concern,
And we walk in the world of safe people, and at night we walk into our houses and burn.

Iowa oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
How I long to fall just a little bit, to dance out of the lines and stray from the light,
But I fear that to fall in love with you is to fall from a great and gruesome height.
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, her husband had just left her,
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said,
""what is love, where did it get me? whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Ioway oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
Once I had everything, I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway and the words I've never felt.
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and id do it again,
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion,
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see,
You were a-wandering out on the hills of iowa and you were not thinking of me.

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Time it was I had a dream, and you're the dream come true. 
If I had the world to give, I'd give it all to you. 
I'll take you to the mountains, I will take you to the sea. 
I'll show you how this life became a miracle to me. 

You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day. 
So when they ask how far love goes, 
When my job's done you'll be the one who knows. 

All the things you treasure most will be the hardest won. 
I will watch you struggle long before the answers come. 
But I won't make it harder, I'll be there to cheer you on, 
I'll shine the light that guides you down the road you're walking on. 

You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day. So when they ask how far love goes, 
When my job's done you'll be the one who knows. 

Before the mountains call to you, before you leave this home, 
I want to teach your heart to trust, as I will teach my own, 
But sometimes I will ask the moon where it shined upon you last, 
And shake my head and laugh and say it all went by too fast. 

You'll fly away, but take my hand until that day. So when they ask how far love goes, 
When my job's done you'll be the one who knows.",The One Who Knows,2010

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We packed up our books and our dishes
Our dreams and your worsted wool suits
We sailed on the eighth of December
Farewell old Hudson River
Here comes the sea
And love was as new and as bright and as true
When I loved you and you loved me

Two steamer trunks in the carriage
Safe arrival we cabled back home
It was just a few days before Christmas
We filled our stockings with wishes
And walked for hours
Arm and arm through the rain, to the glassed-in cafe
That held us like hot house flowers

Living in Paris, in attics and garrets
Where the coal merchants climb every stair
The dance hall next door is filled with sailors and whores
And the music floats up through the air
There's Sancerre and oysters, cathedrals and cloisters
And time with its unerring aim
For now we can say we were lucky most days
And throw a rose into the Seine

Love is the greatest deceiver
It hollows you out like a drum
And suddenly nothing is certain
As if all the clouds closed the curtains
And blocked the sun
And friends now are strangers in this city of dangers
As cold and as cruel as they come

Sometimes I look at old pictures
And smile at how happy we were
How easy it was to be hungry
It wasn't for fame or for money
It was for love
Now my copper hair's grey as the stone on the quay
In the city where magic was

Living in Paris, in attics and garrets
Where the coal merchants climb every stair
The dance hall next door is filled with sailors and whores
And the music floats up through the air
There's Sancerre and oysters, and Notre Dame's cloisters
And time with its unerring aim
And now we can say we were lucky most days
And throw a rose into the Seine
And now I can say I was lucky most days

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The past comes upon you like smoke on the air
You can smell it and find yourself gone
To a place that you lived without worry or care
Isn't that where we all once came from

Green leaves and tall trees and stars overhead
And the sound of the world through the screen
But now you sleep with the covers pulled over your head
And you never remember to dream

You think you're just standing still
One day you'll get up that hill
In the age of miracles
Is one on the way

Greenland is melting, the west is on fire
But don't ever stop praying for rain
It's a curious place between hope and desire
Different gods, but the prayer is the same

And thousand-year storms seem to form on a breeze
Drowning all living things in their paths
And when a small southern town finds a rope in a tree
We're all once again trapped in the past

It seems we're just standing still
One day we'll get up that hill
In the age of miracles
Is one on the way

We can fly through space with the greatest of ease
We can land in the dust of the moon
We can transform our lives with the tap of the keys
Still we can't shake this feeling of doom

But I woke to find monks pouring into the streets
Marching thousands strong into the rain
Now if courage comes dressed in red robes and bare feet
I will never be fearful again

If I'm just standing still
One day I'll get up that hill
In the age of miracles, is one on the way

Seems we're just standing still
One day we'll ride up that hill

Catching the wind as it went south
And I could touch every inch of sky

And there's just dust instead of green
It's just a dream, it's just a dream

Standing on the precipice
I leaned to see just where the edge would take me
The wind came up, I closed my eyes
I heard a shout and to my surprise
A hand reached out and pulled me back to safety

What's a hand, what's a dream

Can disappear
Don't look back, the spirits cry
Just be glad to be alive

Life feels smaller than this stone
Worn smooth inside my palm
I keep it like a charm inside my pocket
I keep thinking I'll flame out
Leave no one with a doubt
That I was meant to fire like a rocket

What's a stone, what's a flame
There's always someone else to blame
When everything that you know disappears
Don't look back the spirits cry
Just be glad to be alive
Everything that you need is right here

The ancient basalt moor
Will beckon me to sleep among its heather

On a summer's day of 1963
Station wagons parked in the drive
Dents in the fender and wood on the side
There's kids and dogs and instamatic cubes squinting hard in the sun
Not just yet, but one day too
They'll be chasing what's already gone

Trying to never admit not feeling good enough
Until you find your passion and you find your way

And it seems to happen nearly overnight
Life shows you who you've become
And there's no more mystery in the fading light
You're just chasing what's already gone

Like the line that spells the far horizon
Moving with you as fast as you can run
Half your life you pay it no attention
The rest you can't stop wondering
What you should have done
Instead of chasing what's already gone

He was smiling and saying ""You're gonna be all right""
And this morning I stared back at myself
Feeling as empty as I've ever felt

More of what's right than what's wrong
It's ashes and roses and time that burns
When you're chasing what's already gone

How tough we are to please

All in good stead
I'm safe and I'm fed
With dreams in my head
Good night

The feel of my hand being taken
Driving at night all alone
The breeze on a warm summer evening
And coming home

All in good time
Somehow you find
Days that still shine with light
All in good stead
You're safe and you're fed
With dreams in your head
Good night

Don't need much to be happy
A friend to soften a fall
And something to show for my labors
After all

I had to learn to be grateful
I had to learn how to see
Mistakes that might have proved fatal
Are gifts I now receive",Don't Need Much to Be Happy,2012
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I tried going west where the sky meets the sun
Where the edge of the world's always been
As far from this place as a girl gets to run
When her reasons to stay have worn thin

Out there the days were so bright and so blue
Yet I missed all my thunder and rain
The way a storm punctures a hot afternoon
Washing away every stain

When my maps pointed north they were calling for snow
To cover all sound and all sight
Tell me where on this earth does all that noise go
Underneath all of that white

With thaws scarcely mentioned I dug out my truck
By the time the storm cleared I was gone
Back on the road with the radio up
Singing at the top of my lungs

Driving and crying and driving some more
Oh the south is a good place to hide
Hot nights, cold beer and creaky screen doors
And a motel's vacancy sign

A letter a day I wrote back home to you
But not one you ever received
Because I can't stand a man who lies like you do
And I can't bear a woman who pleads

One day it dawned I had run out of road
And out of reasons to run
Like a horse to the barn I was hell bent to go
As fast going back as I'd come

Home, home was the song that I sang
As I pulled in just before dark
There was only a hook where your coat used to hang
That's where I hung up my heart

I tried going west, where the sky meets the sun",I Tried Going West,2012
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"You can't see me yet
Seeing takes a long, long time
From the outside in
Measuring each shift and sigh

But as you let your eyes adjust
To the darkness deep within
Sifting throughthe ash and dust
We are the places that we've been

You can't hear me yet
Listening takes a long, long time
And I've so much to tell
But words die on these lips of mine

But in the stillness you may sense
Every thing I long to say
Unraveling like golden threads
The walls will all come down this way

You don't know me yet
Knowing takes a long, long time
And time is all we have
Never traveling in straight lines

So memorize each turn and twist
Just be careful as you go
For if love is a labyrinth

Then my heart is Jericho",Jericho,2012
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Grief rides quietly on the passenger side
Unwanted company on a long, long drive
It turns down the quiet songs and turns up the din
It goes where you go, it's been where you've been

And pushing your empty cart mile after mile
Leaves you weeping in the wilderness
Of the supermarket aisle
And in the late night kitchen light it sits in a chair
Watching you pretend that it's not really there

But it is, so it is and you ask
Are you predator or friend
The future or the past?

It hands you your overcoat and opens the door
You are learning the world again just as before
But the first time was childhood
And now you are grown
Broken wide open, cut to the bone

And all that you used to know is of no use at all
The same eyes you've always had have you walking into walls
And the same heart can't understand
Why it's so hard to feel
What used to be true
What's now so unreal

But it is, so it is and you say
I wish I were the wind so that I could blow away

Grief sits silently on the edge of your bed
It's closing your eyes, it's stroking your head
The dear old companion is taking up air
Watching you pretend that it's not really there",Learning the World,2012
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We are sitting at a table in a bar in Baltimore
It's the last night of December
And the room is nearly full
And the front door pulls a draft in every time it opens wide
And you are telling me a story
From another time and life

And the waitress brings our order
And we're tucked in mighty close
And I feel like we belong among
The living and these ghosts
And I know that I am dreaming
As I memorize each part
In the telling lies a reverie
In the details lie the heart

Like the folds of summer dresses
Like the scent upon my wrist
Like the way you played guitar
Like a boxer punches with his fist
And taken or just lost to me
It's better now to say
I dwell in possibility
On New Year's Day

There's a jukebox or a bandstand
And we're on another round
And the night's just getting started
Or the night's just winding down
And your stories are not clouded yet by the ale
Or by the gin
They just make me feel as if I've known you
All my life again

Like the folds of summer dresses
Like the scent upon my wrist
Like the way you played guitar
Like a boxer punches with his fist
And taken or just lost to me
It's better now to say
I dwell in possibility
On New Year's Day

And this is what it looked like
When we started walking home
The night sky bleached to silver
Against the city's bones
In dreams or in our waking
It's just enough to say
Love and grace and endless flowers
Be ours on New Year's Day

And the folds of summer dresses
And the bangles on my wrist
And the way you played guitar
Like a boxer punches with his fist
And taken or just lost to us
It's better now to say
We dwell in possibility
On New Year's Day",New Year's Day,2012
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"All of our dreams are laid out and measured
Arrows and pins and a rainbow of threads
Like hope on a string, sewn into the linings
For the courage to face the unknown ahead

Out in the world somewhere

I'll meet you there

I'm packing my compass, trusted and tested
My dog-eared maps to study and fold
Into a pocket, I'm traveling light now
All that we have is all that we hold

Just like a star

There are no borders, there are no boundaries
There are no fences up around me
But I get quiet and I get lonely
Just like everyone

I look for my ride, you wait for your train
These are the chances, a life's incantations
These are the places that don't know our names

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"From twenty thousand feet
I saw the lights below me
Twinkling just like christmas
We descended slowly

And the curve of the world passed
With all of that flying
Above the mighty ocean
And now we all are arriving

Grab the carry on baggage
Join the herd for the mad run
Take a place in the long line
Where does every one come from?

As we shuffle on forward
As we wait for inspection
Don't be holding that line up
At the end lies redemption
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah

Now I'm stamped and I'm waved through
I take up my position
At the mouth of the cannon
Saying prayers of contrition

Please deliver my suitcase
From all mischief and peril
Now the sight of it circling
Is a hymn to the faithful

Forgive me for my staring, for my unconcealed envy
In the hall of arrivals where the great river empties
It's hand carts and porters
All the people it carries
To be greeted with flowers
Grandfathers and babies
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah

There is no one to meet me
Yet I'm all but surrounded
By the tears and embracing
By the joy unbounded

The friends and relations
Leaping over hemispheres
Transcendental reunion
All borders vanish here

We are travelers traveling
We are gypsies together
We're philosophers gathering
We are business or pleasure

We are going or coming
We're just finding our way
To the next destination
And from night into day
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah,
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah

I flew over the ocean
From twenty thousand feet high

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"These are your instructions
Should you choose to follow
Sit down with pen and paper
Begin with something hollow
Like the last words that he offered
No kind of explanation
They only take up space here
You do not need to save them

Open up the closet
Find his winter coat there
Check inside the pockets
Find a crumpled note there
It says ""milk and Sunday paper""
And a heart smudged in blue ink
Fold it up and box it before you've time to think

Sundays are the hardest
Avoid familiar back roads
Erase the old phone numbers
Delete all the photos
And those you haven't heard from
Will come as no surprise
They made their calculation
When they chose a side

These are your instructions
When you become reclusive
When old friends say they miss you
When sleep becomes elusive
Fill up every journal
Empty every shoebox
Burn the lists and letters
Sweep out all the old thoughts
Shake off all the covers
Throw every window open
Stand here in your bare feet
Welcome in the morning
These are your instructions
When grace has left you stranded
When you are lost and wounded
Bleeding and abandoned

Use a tourniquet for pressure
Let time do it's healing
Say prayers for good measure
When you think you've lost all feeling

See the outline on the pillow
Smooth it without weeping

From front porch onto back seat

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I guess he'd rather be in Colorado.
He'd rather spend his time out where the sky looks like a pearl after the rain.
Once again I see him walking, once again I hear him talking
To the stars he makes and asking them the bus fare.

I guess he'd rather be in Colorado.
He'd rather play his banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely gone.
In the dawn the subway's coming, in the dawn I hear him humming

I got it all wrong I miss you
Don't know what I was thinking

For what my heart was saying

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Today Joseph is sitting alone
With occasional nods to the waitress
She tops off his cup while she's snapping her gum
Making her rounds on the lunch shift
Counting out coins, he leaves them arranged
In neat lines and circles and arcs
She just stares at the tip that spells out her name
And ideas are like stars

And yesterday pedaling down 4th Avenue
Between the stalls and the bookshops
The sepia tones of a lost afternoon
Cradled a curio storefront
And inside the air was thick with the past
As the dust settled onto his heart
And here for a moment is every place in the world
And ideas are like stars

They fall from the sky, they run round your head
They litter your sleep as they beckon
They'd teach you to fly without wires or thread
They promise if only you'd let them

For the language of longing never had words
So how did you speak from your heart?
Yet here is a box that swears it has heard
That ideas are like stars

Tonight Joseph stood out in the yard
As Debussy played from the kitchen
Celestial companions till mornings first lark
Shone overhead and he listened
And who was that shadow there by the gate?
Who was that there standing guard?
It was only loneliness and loneliness waits
And ideas are like stars
Ideas are like stars",Ideas Are Like Stars,2014
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"We packed up our books and our dishes
Our dreams and your worsted wool suits
We sailed on the eighth of December
Farewell old Hudson River
Here comes the sea
And love was as new and as bright and as true
When I loved you and you loved me

Two steamer trunks in the carriage
Safe arrival we cabled back home
It was just a few days before Christmas
We filled our stockings with wishes and walked for hours
Arm and arm through the rain, to the glassed-in cafe
That held us like hot house flowers

Living in Paris, in attics and garrets
Where the coal merchants climb every stair
The dance hall next door is filled with sailors and whores
And the music floats up through the air
There's Sancerre and oysters, cathedrals and cloisters
And time with its unerring aim
For now we can say we were lucky most days
And throw a rose into the Seine

Love is the greatest deceiver
It hollows you out like a drum
And suddenly nothing is certain
As if all the clouds closed the curtains
And blocked the sun
And friends now are strangers in this city of danger
As cold and as cruel as they come

Sometimes I look at old pictures
And smile at how happy we were
How easy it was to be hungry
It wasn't for fame or for money
It was for love
And now my copper hair's grey
As the stone on the quay
In the city where magic was

Living in Paris, in attics and garrets
Where the coal merchants climb every stair
The dance hall next door is filled with sailors and whores
And the music floats up through the air
There's Sancerre and oysters, and Notre Dame's cloisters
And time with its unerring aim
For now we can say we were lucky most days
And throw a rose into the Seine
Now I can say I was lucky most days
And throw a rose into the Seine",Mrs. Hemingway,2014
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can recall the sound of the wind
As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
And I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
This kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down
Say it as only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream",Only a Dream,2014

There were three of us to do the driving
The sky turned black outside of Laramie 
And the rain poured down all over Wyoming 
It took two long days and four full tanks of gas 
To get to Livingston

In between the silences and the feeling grateful 
I had so much time for remembering 
Late nights around some ones table 
Something deeper about those gatherings 
More than once I've been far far away 
And thinking bout Livingston

On the way back home I would stop awhile 
Ease this truck onto the shoulder of the road 
It’s a long straight line 
That goes for miles and miles
It’s as lonely as a great plains Conoco

I came to say good bye, and to hug you 
But I wasn’t brave enough to say that
So I said see you soon and I love you 
And I think you understood me from way back 
From the very first time we ever sang our songs
Late one night in Livingston

On the way back home I would stop awhile 
Ease this truck onto the shoulder of the road 
It’s a long straight line 
That goes for miles and miles
It’s as empty as a great plains Conoco

To the dark dead ends with their missing signs

Like the stories we tell tracing the routes 
Wind in my ears, dirt on my boots

The map of my heart is torn at the corners 
From ignoring the warnings, disobeying the orders 
I’ve been lost in a crowd, found in solitary 
I learned how to travel with just what I could carry 
Towards the vast unseen and the great unknown 
The map of a heart is all that we own 

Leaving safety to chance and reason behind 
X marks every spot I thought I’d lost my mind 
I didn’t think that I could but I couldn’t stop trying

And I can’t stop trying to hold in my hands 
That moment I could feel my heart expand 
With more love than I thought could exist in the world 
The hollows were gone, the emptiness filled 
A life transformed down to the bone 
This map of my heart is all that I own

Do we ever stop feeling apart and alone 
Do we ever stop dreaming of where we belong

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I circled twice then pulled in by the shopping carts 
In a cold steady rain coming down in the parking lot 
I saw him leave his truck running and duck into the store 
I just sat there thinking I’d seen him before

There was something so familiar about him 
In the eyes of someone who hasn’t forgotten 
The shape of a chance as it catches the light 
In the millions of rain drops falling that night 

So I dug in my bag for a pen and some paper 
Found an envelope, tore it in half 
I wrote down some words with my name and my number 
And then I took a big breath

There’s nothing holding us down 
I’m not made of stone or of steel 
I slipped it beneath the wiper blades 
Just a note on a windshield

When you find yourself out of things to believe in 
Apart and adrift, no point and no reason 
Is there nothing to fear because there’s nothing to lose? 
If it were a choice which one would you choose?

There’s time you can trust and time that you question 
Time you ignore and time you don’t mention 
Time that you wish you could get back somehow 
When see you how fast its flying by now 

There’s nothing holding us down 
I’m not made of stone or of steel 
Will the wind blow you away 
Like a note on a windshield

There’s nothing holding us down 
And no words for the way that you feel 
You just watch the rain pour 
On a note on a windshield

Some days I still think I could be someone else 
Those are the days I feel lost to myself 
Mistaking a stranger, misplacing a heart 
How to put back together what’s been taken apart

I didn’t want to leave but I didn’t want to linger 
Fatalist, optimist, magical thinker 
You only hold on until you let go 
Turning the key, I pulled away slow

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I’m telling you these things that I tell no one else
When I’m all alone
When I’m by myself
And I believe you hear me though I have no proof
It’s what I feel inside
That’s telling me the truth
If I listen and I cannot hear the music
If I try to swim the ocean and cannot reach the shore
If the world is offered love but doesn’t use it
Oh Rosetta, what’s it for?

May I call you sister when we talk this way?
You make me feel as if there’s nothing I can’t say
I know I’m not the first one you’ve brought comfort to
And I’m not the last that will look to you
If I wander and I cannot find the reason
If I keep my heart wide open and cannot feel the sun
And I’m not sure anymore what I believe in
Oh Rosetta, am I the only one?

One day I am walking down a lonely street
New York City’s cold, there is no one to meet
And at the corner of 57th and 7th Avenue
I hear someone sing and I know it’s you
If I’m still and I cannot hear the choirs
If I try to please the many instead of just the very few
Can you hear me through invisible wires?
Oh Rosetta, what should I do?

If I listen and I cannot hear the music
If I swim against the current and lose sight of the shore
If the world is offered goodness but doesn’t use it
Oh Rosetta, what’s it for?",Oh Rosetta,2016
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"There's a shoebox full of letters
Bound up neatly with some twine
Each one was like a diamond,
Now the jewel is lost to time

My reward is in the knowing
That I held it in my hands for a little while

What else are there
But the treasures in your heart?

Something tamed
Something wild

For every time that I've been
Foolish when I'd wish that I'd been wise

The power of regret still gets me
Right between the eyes

And sometimes I want to weep
With nothing but the tears of a little child

What else are there but
The lessons in your heart?

Something tamed
Something wild

Here's a map I've memorized of
Everywhere I've ever been

And the faces of everyone I've
Loved and left to try again

I couldn't make out
What they were saying

So instead I listened hard to what's inside

What else are there but
The voice in your heart?

Something tamed
Something wild

Some nights I'm woken up by
Something stirring in my chest

It's a feeling I've no name for
It's hard to catch my breath

I'm staring down the great big lonesome
As I'm listening for
The dwindling of time

What else are there but
The echoes in your heart?

Something tamed
Something wild

So the things that matter to me
Now are different from the past

I care less about arriving than
Just being in the path
Of some light carved out of nothing

The way it feels when the universe has smiled

What else are there but
The beating of your heart?

Something tamed
Something wild

There's the shoebox full of letters
There's the map I won't forget
The voices and the lessons
And the signals that connect us

Manifested to the spirit
Way deep down where it goes unseen by the eye

What else is there but the love inside your heart?

To a life like a firework's to a spark
Over and above you in it's arc

Something tamed
Something wild",Something Tamed Something Wild,2016
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I remember driving down the rutted roads late at night 
Following the summer moon bright as any pair of headlights 
I felt the air on my face and the night pressed inside my palm 
A moment captured in a place this memory stays strong

Oh my darling oh my love 
Oh my darling oh my love 
Oh my darling oh my love 
The things that we are made of

And I remember feeling I’m alive and in no need of saviors 
If the past’s another country I’m at the border with my papers 
Where is your heart if not inside you where is home or are you lost 
Where is love if not beside you I had no answers but they let me cross

Oh my darling oh my love 
Oh my darling oh my love 
Oh my darling oh my love 
The things that we are made of

Like the silence of my shadow when the twilight world is calling 
The loneliness that knows me by the cadence of my walking 
And the scar upon my elbow and the sound of my own breathing 
My reflection in a window and the way I’m always leaving 

And I remember wishing for some other life than this one I’ve claimed 
How often have I been convinced how eagerly I’d make that trade 
Then all at once I see your face and the summer night and the open door 
Dimmer now but not erased and I know what these are for

Oh my darling oh my love 
Oh my darling oh my love 
Oh my darling oh my love

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"From departure to arrival
What does it mean to travel
With your suitcase by the handle
Holding everything you need

Are you going or are you coming
Walking slow or running
Toward somebody or from something
Trade your longing in for speed

And the freedom to be a stranger
Is a bargain that's ours alone
Sometimes you just want to be someone else
Unencumbered and unknown

From departure to arrival
What does it mean to travel
And from taking off to landing
You could feel your heart expanding
You walked halfway down Manhattan
Till you met the Brooklyn Bridge

And in a two A.M transmission
From a high wire act position
How the skyline behind you glistened
As if someone pulled a switch 
And I don't want to be a stranger
And I don't want to be alone
But sometimes I just want to be somewhere else
Untethered and unknown

To go up to my white walled room out on the end of time
Where I can be with my love for she is all that is mine 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time 

I laugh with her, cry with her, hold her close she is mine
The way she tells me of her love and never is she trying 
She don't have to be assured of many good things to find 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time

Her eyes are dark and deep with love, her hair hangs long and fine 
She walks with ease and all she sees is never wrong or right 
And with her arms around me tight I see her all in my mind
And she'll always be there my love don't care about time",She Don't Care About Time,2016
Mary Cleere Haran,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1992

Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss

To think about the road I've run the miles I've come
There is a bed where troubles melt away
My lonely hours or hours with you
The times that we've come through

There is a bed where we shared times of love
And out of love those nights are memories best forgot
We argued about trivial things
And slept apart a wall we built among the sheets

There is a bed where sickness left its touch
And fever damp the sheets where I would shake all night
Cold burning on my brow
Hallucinations here and now
A fight to live or die

There is a bed where first we both made love
And left the marks, reminders of how good it felt
The hard, the soft, the sweat in midnight's hour
We built the fort, we climbed the tower

There is a bed where years will make us wise
Truth and lies defeat, despise and forgiving
The sheets our cradle birth to death
The twists and turns of love, the life we're living

There is bed where nights I lay awake
To think about my future to forget my past
My bed a boat to sail the seas
To land where safety finds me gripping to the mast

And though I feel the years slip through my fingers
Sorrow lingers and won't go away
There is a bed that is my sanctuary
A bed where I can end my days

A dream to call my own

A thrill I'd never known

And reachin' out to hold me, when I had a nightmare
You could read quite a story in the callous' and lines
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind

I remember daddy's hands how they held my mama tight
And patted my back for something done right
There are things that I'd forgotten that I loved about the man
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to understand
There was always love in daddy's hands

I remember daddy's hands workin' 'til they bled
Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed
If I could do things over, I'd live my life again
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle but I've come to understand

I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine

And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet

Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence

Mary Ellen Bernard,"Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella 

Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew 

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

Mary Ellen Desmond,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie away 
from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing

Marooned in a dreary old town
So we packed up our dreams
And our dresses
As a cold rain was patterning down

Asleep above frozen dark waters
The wind carried us cross the sea
The sun woke us over Gibraltar
Tired and hopeful and free

Annie roll down your window
Have you seen a sky so blue
It's always lovely traveling with you

On midsummer nights in Coimbra
We drank porto til we were full
With the man with a scar on his forearm
Who said he'd been gored by a bull

September we stayed near the ocean
And we lived in a little blue shack
Cavorting at night with the tall trees
The neighbors hope we don't come back

Annie roll down your window
Have you seen a sky so blue
It's always lovely traveling with you

With winter upon us in Dublin
An Irishman played with your hair
You lost your heart at The Old Bailey
And some part of it still might be there

Over clouds and endless rainbows
From my point of view
It's all been lovely

So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

One day before work we got drunk and danced in the rain
They fired us both, they said
""Don't y'all come back here again""

Drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in

My dad went to college, and he worked for the state
He never quit nothing and he wanted me to graduate
My brother and sister both play in the marching band
They tell me they miss me, but I know they don't understand

Sometimes you got do
What you gotta do
And hope that the people you love
Will catch up with you

Yeah, drag queens in limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
Poets and AWOL marines
Actors and bar flys
Writers with dark eyes
Drunks that philosophize

Mary Gauthier,"He'd get home at 5:30
Fix his drink, sit down in his chair
Pick a fight with mama
Complain about us kids getting in his hair

At night he'd sit 'lone and smoke
I'd see his frown behind his lighter's flame
Now that same frown's in my mirror
I got my daddy's blood inside my veins

Fish swim, birds fly
Daddies yell, mamas cry
Old men sit and think
I drink

Chicken, TV, dinner
6 minutes on defrost, 3 on high
Beer to wash it down with then another
A little whiskey on the side

It's not so bad alone here
It don't bother me that every night's the same
I don't need another lover
Hanging 'round, trying to make me change

Fish swim, birds fly
Lovers leave by and by
Old men sit and think
I drink

I know what I am
But I don't give a damn

Fish swim, birds fly
Daddies yell, mamas cry
Old men sit and think
I drink

There's a tiny village with its landscape painted green
A firehouse, a general store, all the streets are clean
The people at the depot love to hear that whistle sound
And they all wave at Jackie when the engine comes around.

He says roll train roll
The steel and all its rhythm
Are sweet music to his soul.
You'll be riding safe tonight
Come hell or freezing rain
The red caps got your baggage
All Aboard!! Jackies Train

A cow strays from the meadow
She's stranded on the track
Jackie's fingers lift her up
Then gently put her back
The train chugs on down the line
Through the kitchen and the den
Disappearing under Jackies bed
And back to town again.

Yes its Roll train Roll
The steel and all its rhythm
Are sweet music to his soul.
You'll be riding safe tonight
Come hell or freezing rain
The red caps got your baggage
All aboard! Jackies train

Jackie never stops the train when he's home all alone
He keeps her rolling round and round till mama, comes home

Jackie can't go out to play, the village needs him there
Every little detail of the train gets all his care
Gotta keep it rolling, gotta stay on time
When he dies they'll honor him
For miles on down the line.

Yes its Roll train Roll
The steel and all its rhythm
Are sweet music to his soul.
You'll be riding safe tonight
Come hell or freezing rain
The red caps got your baggage

Mary Gauthier,"A little girl lost, her world full of pain
He said it feels good, she gave him her vein
The dope made her numb and numb felt like free
Until she came down, down, down to a new misery

A junkie, a whore living for the next high
She'd lie cheat and steal, she forgot how to cry
Wide awake for two weeks, shooting heroin then speed
When she killed in cold, cold blood all she felt was her need

It's an eye for an eye, now you're gonna die
A tooth for a tooth, it's your moment of truth
There's no mercy here, your stay is denied
Go on and pray, pray, pray, there's mercy in the sky

Alone in her cell, no dope in her veins
The killer'd become, little girl lost again
She fell to her knees, she prayed she would die
On the cold cement floor, she finally cried

And love came like the wind, love whispered her name
It reached through and held her, lifted her pain
Fifteen years on death row, her faith deeper each day
Her last words were, ?I love you all?
Good-bye, Karla Faye

Now it's an eye for an eye and you're gonna die
A tooth for a tooth, it's your moment of truth
There's no mercy here, your stay is denied
Go on and pray, pray, pray
",Karla Faye,1999
Mary Gauthier,"I called my mama yesterday
To wish her happy birthday
She said, ?Baby, your mama's getting old
And I'm damn glad to be alive today?

She said, ?I'm 10 years cancer free
And I thank the good Lord everyday
But Marie, she's got it bad
And honey, Patsy's passed away?

She said a lifetime ain't no time at all
She said a lifetime ain't no time at all

I listened to my mama's voice
And I felt a chill pass right through
'cause I've seen the virus take the boys
And I've watched my friends get sick too

We talked about how Michael died
With his friends around him everyday
How we all took turns by his side
How we helped him disappear that way

I know a lifetime ain't no time at all
I know a lifetime ain't no time at all

Mama said, ?Ain't we a mess?
Child, we're full of life and scared of death
It must be hell to watch your friends die young
But getting old now, there's some fun?

You know, life'd mean nothing if we didn't die
Laughter, empty, if we didn't cry
It's all the way it's supposed to be
But it moves fast and it's hard to see

We both know what it means
Packing bags and tying up loose ends
Lettin' go of busted dreams

Silence fills the room tonight
You've never been this cold
To leave me sliding down your icy look
With nowhere to grab a hold

I know it's hard to know the truth
So we live with points of view
I'm counting on my lucky stars
I used to count on you

Everything you do to me
I've done to you before
There's beauty in the symmetry
Of evening the score

Did we dance a whispered waltz, did I hold you in my sight?
When morning came with open arms she lifted you from me
The sunlight burned my eyes away now I cannot see

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars as I face the early light
All that I can think of now is joining you in flight
But I have followed gypsy's girl, I've lost my way back home
I've held the phoenix to my chest and ended up alone

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars teach me how to know
I want to feel my thoughts go dark and rest inside your flow
I'll awaken without fear and breathe the cool clean air
With your words upon my lips your will becomes my prayer

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Our Lady of the Shooting Stars look what you have done
You've led me to the water's edge, running from sun
Are you in the briny mist? Do Seagulls scream your name?
Their wings suspended by your love, or do I reach for you in vain?

If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?

Last night I drowned I got carried away
Swept up in the feelings the words poured out of me
This morning I'm so scared I don't know how to be

My heart moves
With the morning sun
It's not ready to set for anyone
When I said, ""I love you""
It was a slip of the tongue

I didn't lie but it wasn't the truth
I know it's not right but what can I do
My memories haunt me they never let me go
There's someone on my mind and I think you should know

My heart moves
With the morning sun
It's not ready to set for anyone

You're angry 'cause you watched me turn to stone
But soon the walls I've built are gonna crumble

After you're gone I'm gonna miss you
After you're gone I'll call your name
As soon as I can't I'll want to kiss you
Then I'll realize we'll never kiss again

After you're gone I'll fall to pieces
After you're gone, it's me I'll blame
I'll think of all the kindness you've shown me
And I'll hate myself 'cause I never change

In his T-shirt and his underwear he's barely said a word
She pours a cup of coffee, lights the day's first cigarette
Picks up the phone and calls her kids from the motel kitchenette

There's two guys moving slowly in the room across the hall
Both their heads are pounding from last night's alcohol
They met in a chat room then they took it here
They both go by pseudonyms and soon they'll disappear

Cheaters, liars, outlaws and fallen angels
Come looking for the grace from which they fell
So they hold on to each other in the darkness
'Cause the morning light is hell at the Camelot Motel

He met her at the pool hall, the guys told him she is touched
Now she's ranting and she's raving about the Devil, Christ and such
He's thinking about the highway and the way she begged last night
He's wishing that he had blown this dump before the morning light

Cheaters, liars, outlaws and fallen angels
Come looking for the grace from which they fell
So they hold on to each other in the darkness
'Cause the morning light is hell at the Camelot Motel

Lancelot and Guenevere bang their bedpost in my ear
Neon lights the castle walls, bug lights in the entrance halls
I lie awake with a troubled mind thinking 'bout what I left behind
Me and the royal denizens got damn good reasons for our sins

Now there's a couple counting money in room 124
They're wrapping 10's and 20's throwing the 1's down on the floor
They're strung out and they're nervous, they jump at every little sound
He keeps picking up his pistol then putting his pistol down

Red ribbons and silver bells, angels dressed in white
He tied, it to the bridge rail so passing cars could see
He danced a little dance up there, looked down and smiled at me

My bed is a lawn chair, cushions keep it soft
I sleep in the open air, under the Southern Cross
Next to the golf course by the Hyatt Hotel
Davey he is a friend of mine and we get along pretty well

Christmas in paradise under the Cow Key Bridge
Where the warm breeze blows so nice
And the landlord forgives

Snowbirds on the golf course wear Bermuda shorts and Polo shirts
Some play pretty good some play so bad it hurts
We pick up their golf balls that fly over the fence
We shine 'em up a little bit and sell 'em back for fifty cents

Christmas in paradise under the Cow Key Bridge
Where the warm breeze blows so nice
And the landlord forgives

I won't lie, we just get by but we'll be eating good tonight
Christmas dinner at 5 o'clock over at the Church of Life
They don't care who you are, they don't ask what you done
Come on down and bring a friend there's plenty for everyone

Christmas in paradise under the Cow Key Bridge
Where the warm breeze blows so nice
And the landlord forgives

And Davey shouts, ?Merry Christmas y'all?

Born a bastard child in New Orleans
To a woman I've never seen
I don't know if she ever held me
All I know is that she let go of me

I passed through like thunder
I passed through like rain
Passed out from under
Good-bye could have been my family name

Every time I settle down it happens
I get a restless feeling I can't control
I hit the wall, then I hit the highway
I've got the curse of a gypsy on my soul

So I move through like thunder
I move through like rain
Moving out from under
Good-bye could have been my family name

I can't break free of the winds that blow me
They roll in like a Gulf Coast Hurricane
I'd love to stay now but I don't know how
Hold me honey till I'm gone again

When it's time to leave forever
I pray the Lord don't take me slow.
I don't know where I'm going
I just wanna say good-bye and go

And I'll move through like thunder
Push through like rain
Pushing out from under

Mary Gauthier,"Under water, under the well
Under glass, under a ground swell
Chasing bliss, chasing my tail
Chasing desire, straight down to Hell

I couldn't love, could not forgive
I didn't know how to live and let live
My choices were few
On the ledge, looking up at you

Overdrawn, overfed
Overrun, over my head
I held a grudge, I held a gun
I held contempt for everyone

I couldn't cry, I couldn't learn
I didn't flinch when bridges burned
I was lost, through and through
On the ledge, looking up at you

I lived alone, I lived in rage
I lived in darkness inside a cage
On the fringe, a refugee
I couldn't trace it back to me

I grew mean, I grew small
I grew tired of it all
I couldn't tell false from true
On the ledge, looking up at you

Out of luck, out of time
Out of control, out of my mind
Running scared, running down
Running low to the ground

The blows were hard, the blows were mean
The blows were low, the blows were clean
I was left black and blue
On the ledge, looking up at you

I felt the flames on my face

when I found the nerve to meet your eyes, so green

I stumbled towards your elegance

I tumbled, wide awake into a dream

and there you stood, so beautiful

destiny seduces, after all

I fell into the fire

that's a long way to fall


You gave me strength to speak

when my voice was weak and words were hard to find

your faith in me was solid and

it stood me up when I couldn't steady mine

all those times I cried at night

you promised me it'd be all right

you held me while my demons danced and crawled

I fell into your open arms

that's a long way to fall


A long way to fall

a long way to fall

I never should have drifted

I never should have left you all alone

I don't know what comes over me

looks like I'll always be

the troubled kid that runs away from

home

I reached for you the other night

you rolled away and moved against the wall

I fell into the space between us

that's a long way to fall


A long way to fall

a long way to fall


I got no one to hold on to and

I'm sinking slowly to my knees

I might learn to pray down here

or maybe I'll beg you baby, please

but you stare at me with marble eyes

and I don't think I've ever

felt this small

I've fallen out of your good graces

that's a long way to fall


A long way to fall, a long way to fall

a long way to fall, a long way to fall

Ripping darkness out your eyes
To every kiss with bourbon breath
Your daddy didn't hide, he didn't hide

From the crack of his backhand slap
To your mama's blue veined hands
That held her rosary desperately
'Cause she didn't understand

From the brokenhearted playground
In the lonely afternoon
To the violence of little boys
And the crying in your bedroom

Till the wind blows right through you and rain don't get you wet
Till your lips move constantly but you ain't said nothing yet
Till you ride that horse in circles, going up and coming down
Round and round, it's a merry go round

From the bitter tears of helplessness
Falling from your grandma's face
As they strap you to the stretcher
While she quickly packs your suitcase

From the money that you stole
From her on the day she died
To the long lines at the clinic
Waiting for a days supply, a days supply

Till the wind blows right through you and rain don't get you wet
Till your lips move constantly but you ain't said nothing yet
Till you ride that horse in circles, going up and coming down
Round and round, it's a merry go round

From the phone booth on the freeway
When there's no one left to call
To the porcelain cod you pray to
In the public restroom stall

From the milky white of heroin
As it bubbles and it sooths
To the dirty sheets you lie on

A year is a drop in a bucket
When you lose someone you love

I don't get back to Nashville till June
And I played my songs all over the world

With its birds of prey circling overhead
Casting vulture shadows on barren beds

Rings your name every hour
I see your face, I touch your hair

With its holy whispers and labyrinth lies

I search your silence looking for a crack
For a passageway, where I can pull you back

Satchmo takes a solo, and he flashes his million dollar smile
Marie Laveau promenades with Oscar Wilde
Big funky Stella twirls her little red umbrella to the beat
As the soul parade winds it's way down Eternity Street

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
So, ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Mardi Gras Indians chant in the streets at sundown
Spy boy meets spy boy, and big chief meets big chief uptown
They circle and sway in their rainbow colored feathers and beads
They prance like peacocks, children of slavery freed

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

The Krewe of the crossbones parades into the midnight sun
They march through the fire and come out beating homemade drums
While the French quarter queens in their high heeled drag disguise
Sing 'Over the rainbow' 'til Judy Garland quivers and sighs

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Flambeau dancers light the walkway to Jean Pierces
There's a party tonight and all the girls are gonna be there
Sipping wormwood concoctions, drinking absinthe and talking trash
It's a red carpet, black tie, all night, celestial bash

Souls ain't born, souls don't die
Soul ain't made of earth, ain't made of water, ain't made of sky
Ride the flaming circle, wind the golden reel
And roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel
I said roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel
Yeah, roll on, brother, in the wheel inside the wheel

Mary Gauthier,"Well, the grasses are swaying, sun's going down
Music is playing, you're weaving through town
Pull into the drive way, toss it in park

You stare out of the windshield, out into the world
It was all for the love of a wayward girl
Who left you with a second place smile and a broken heart

And the streetlights are starting to flicker to life
They glow for a minute then they get bright
Fireflies light up, circle and spark

there's nothing really that you can do
Put your hands in your pockets, try to get through
The distance between the daylight and the dark

And the front porch flags lie themselves down
Like forgotten soldiers and old wedding gowns
In closets unopened and graves without any marks

As the night curtains lower behind the rooftops
Shadows dance across the sidewalks
And ricochet off of the houses like pieces of art

And your mind is reeling as the sky is changing
All you're feeling and you're re-arranging
The rest of your life like lines on an old sailors chart

You climb back in, fire the ignition
Put your hands on the wheel, head into the distance
The distance between the daylight and the dark

This is not my street

This is not my house

That is not my bed

This is not my town

Another day another night

Another night another day

I wanna go home

I can?t find the way


The levee broke the water came

Went all the way up to my roof

I crawled up there and cried

What else could I could do?

Another day another night

Another night another day

I wanna go home

I can?t find the way


A boat brought me to I-10

I sat there three days, maybe four

Thousands stranded on the interstate

Every hour boats brought more

Another day another night

Another night another day

We wanna go home

We can?t find the way


With nothing but our dreams

And memories of who we?ve been

Scattered forth like seeds

At the mercy of the wind

Another day another night

Another night another day

We wanna go home

We can?t find the way


Another day another night

Another night another day

We wanna go home

We can?t find the way

Mary Gauthier,"Broken on the inside, that's what I used to say
Then I?d pack my bags, raise a white flag, drive away
I thought that's what made me strong
But I was young, I was wrong

And I ain't leaving any more
I'm not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay
I'm gonna stand my ground
Stare my demons down, I ain't leaving

I don't know when it happened
But I turned a corner somewhere on the road
And on this side of those stubborn years
Somehow I'm not so broken any more
I pushed away what I shoulda held
Yeah, but sorrow taught me well

And I ain't leaving any more
I'm not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay
I'm gonna stand my ground
Stare my demons down, I ain't leaving

there's still a whisper in my ear
That I'm trying not to hear
Haunted voices from my past
Promises of greener grass
Speaking to me everyday
Fighting hard to have their way

But I ain't leaving any more
I'm not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay

I wanna find out what it?s like
To live a different kind of life
To hang around and fight
For something I believe in

Understand I ain't leaving
I ain't leaving
Broken on the inside
That's what I used to say

Steam Train Maury died last night

His wife Wanda by his side

Caught the Westbound out of here

Hopped the high irons to the by and by

They say he jumped ten thousand trains

Rode a million miles for free

Helped out at VA hospitals and penitentiary?s

Dandy Dave, Rusty Nails and Sweet Lady Sugar Cane

Dead Eye Kate and the Baloney Kid raise their cups tonight in Steam Train?s name

Senators, congressmen, puppets on a string

Among the windswept vagabonds Steam Train was the king

The last of the hobo kings, the last of the hobo kings


Now bums just drink and wander round

Tramps dream and wander too

But a hobo was a pioneer who preferred to work for food

He knew how his nation?s doing

By the length of a side walk cigarette butt

Born with an aching wanderlust

Embedded in his gut

Hounded, beaten, laughed at, broke

Chased out of every town

With a walking stick scepter

And a shredded coffee can crown

The last of the hobo king, the last of the hobo kings


The last free men are hoboes

Steinbeck said, and he paid cash

And the stories that he bought from them

Helped write the Grapes of Wrath

But boxcars have been sealed for years

And trespassers do time

And the railroad yards are razor wired

And hoboing?s a crime

So here?s to you Steam Train Maury

Hold that Westbound tight

As you ride off into history

The last hobo, the last ride

The last of the hobo king, the last of the hobo kings


",Last of the Hobo Kings,2007
Mary Gauthier,"Four nights alone in Amsterdam and I missed you every one
I wish this trip was over and it?s only just begun
I don't know when I?ll see you again
I can't think of it, it?s more than I can bear
I know I only kissed you once
But I hold it on my on my lips like a prayer

I see me in the window of an old café on the boulevard
Looking hunkered down blown around
I've forgotten what I'm out here for
I stood alone last night by the streetlight, aching for you
I watched the snow fall in Berlin
From a hotel room on Karl Marx Avenue

Oh please, I need your love
Oh please, I need your love

I dreamed of you in Belfast
Woke up to the echo of your voice
Walked the streets of Dublin
Talking to myself ?bout love and choice

I forgot the dream in Aberdeen and panicked
'Cause it felt like you were gone
I called your number in despair and you laughed at me
Thank God I was wrong

Oh please, I need your love
Oh please, I need your love

Well, I kissed you once and then I left
And I was hoping that you might remember me
Oh, I didn't even try to stay
I was teasing you with the possibility

Yes, I set a trap but I fell in
And I don't think I'm finished falling yet
What I tried to do to you, I did to me
I guess I'm working off the debt

Going crazy here without you
And it makes no sense at all
On my knees with my arms out
And my back against the wall

I miss you everywhere I go with an ache
That just grows stronger town to town
And if you don't want me, baby
I hope I'm strong enough to just keep moving round

Oh please, I need your love
Oh please, I need your love

Mary Gauthier,"The children are crying, they never got their supper
Where would you run to in the darkness of the night?
Even shadows fear to wander
They gather 'round me in the candlelight

Your crucifix is broken, bloody, sharp and shattered
I smashed it to pieces on the bedroom floor
Pain and prayers and promises scattered
Then I pulled the pistol from the dresser drawer

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, what have I done?
Everything worth holding slips through my fingers
Now my hands wrapped around the handle of a gun

The further I fall, the less I falter
Forsaken, forgotten without love
The slow motion whisper turns into a holler
Forty years of push turns into a shove

Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, what have I done?
Everything worth holding just slips through my fingers
Now my hands wrapped around the handle of a gun

The chair that I sit in belonged to my daddy
Carved from the hard wood of a bitter tree
When he was alive he used tell me
?Kid I knew when you was born
You'd end up snake bit like me?

Look at me, on the high wire

As I attempt to balance safety with desire

Step right up, get your tickets here

What you see should have you trembling with fear

Without a net, here I go

Ladies and gentlemen I promise you a show


As I?m crashing through the clouds I used to walk on

Reaching out for unfamiliar hands

Falling into the eyes of strangers

I wanna smile but I can?t

I?m looking for a soft place to land


When you?re up so high it?s hard to know

If you look foolish waving to the crowd below

It was plain, to everyone but me

Only a fool forgets the pull of gravity

But for a while, didn?t I fly?

Didn?t I shine like a star up in the sky?


Now I?m crashing through the clouds I used to walk on

Reaching out for unfamiliar hands

Falling into the eyes of strangers

I wanna cry but I can?t

I?m looking for a soft place to land

I remember blue sky

I remember company

I remember laughter

I remember everything


As I?m crashing through the clouds I used to walk on

Falling into the eyes of strangers

And it?s hard to find a soft place to land

Ain?t it hard to find a soft place to land

Out in the cold wind, ?round the razor wire fenced in cell block
Young mamas with babies, sisters and other kinds of kin
At Tallulah State Prison on Thanksgiving Day
We're waiting to get in

You gotta get here early
It don't matter how many miles you drove
They make you wait for hours, jailers always move slow
They run names, check numbers
Gravel faced guards they don't smile
Grammy and me in line, silently waitin' single file

Thanksgiving at the prison, surrounded by families
Road weary pilgrims who show up faithfully
Sometimes love ain't easy, sometimes love ain't free

My Grammy looks so old now
Her hair is soft and white like the snow
And her hands tremble
When they frisk her from her head to her toes

They make her take her winter coat off
Then they frisk her again
When they're done she wipes their touch off her dress
Stands tall and heads in

It's thanksgiving at the prison, surrounded by families
Road weary pilgrims who show up faithfully
Even though it ain't easy, even though it ain't free
Sometimes love ain't easy, I guess love ain't free

Mary Gauthier,"Now the flames they followed joan of arc
As she came riding through the dark;
No moon to keep her armour bright,
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She said, I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite.

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
And who are you? she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
And I love your solitude, I love your pride.

Then fire, make your body cold,
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress.

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.

I saw the glory in her eye.

She didn't keep me 'cause my mother loved me too much

As long as we believe
We can get there

There's no mistake
That we met like this
We sealed our fate
With our first kiss
Let the light in our hearts
Lead the way
To the paradise
We discovered
Holding on to each other

We can fly

Too far away, there's
No hope too high

We can get there

Baby, baby)
Ohh
Now we're looking
For a tune forever
And as long as
We can go together
To the paradise
We discovered
Holding on to each other

We can get there
We can fly
(Oh) There's no dream
Too far away, there's
No hope to high

That answers our prayers

Gave me something
To believe
You and I were meant to be
Come inside my heart
You'll see
That's the place
That we'd be free
In this love of destiny
Darling you and me
We can get there

A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

I'm officially the freshest, don't dare forget
I'm gone momentarily, don't bury me, yet
Like Ali got, I got tha title back, prepare for that

When the world needed to ask where he was at
But when he need somethin' back, fade to black
Talking behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin' less in the game of chess

You think five moves ahead and not behind
Jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like yeah, one whole year I got in the grind
But get me losin' off your mind

Shawty, may I remind you that there ain't another
Who done been through what I been through
Time after time again you better get some in you
When you said it was over for him
And you thought he couldn't continue to floss
Here's to your memory loss, sucker

And nine times out of ten, me and out of pocket out of line
You do it big, everybody that you out shined
Then your old lady fate talk 'bout how she got fine

She say she was tryin' to get away, he say about time
Right now we all thinkin', damn hopin' not mine
But when it's lights out for you and you're locked down
Ain't no tellin' whether or not your lady when and got down

With that crawl town 'cause he hot now
Rippin' up your love letters, liftin' up her night gown
Right now somebody baby momma gettin' piped down
Kids in the next room listenin', momma pipe down

The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough for it
Or ain't get that lonely 'cause you wasn't gone long enough
Trump, it's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back, please don't forget that

Don't forget to remember me

Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really looking forward to a future for us
Baby don't worry 'bout it
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you

Even took a second job
So they won't take the clause and put a lean on the
House
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out, ooh
Baby don't worry 'bout it (don't worry)
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you

And them dudes you ran with are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be

All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slippin on them Dior dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith 'n Wesson
Cause them niggas in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta love and that lil' affection
Them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nuttin above you
And behind that vest I got a heart ma gangstas need love too

Some think the worst of you
They portray you as a man, it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's, caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down

I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here whenever you call me babe)
I'll be waiting on you (ooh-oh)
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out

I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here, for you ba-by)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)

I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I will)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me baby)
Baby don't worry about it (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
I'mma be right here, waitin on you (don't you worry)

I'm lookin' for a future with you baby
Wanna see you real soon, real soon, real soon

Check it out y'all, check it, check it out

Give thumbs up 'cause I'm glad I could bring her
Honey clear your throat, yeah, yeah the shit sound dope

Well, here goes the skit, it's the kick a rhyme zing
To the beat shit that you wanna get wit
Brothers try to copy but they just can't get it down right
This is how we move it tonight

So honey is you ready? Yes I'm ready
So, kick the flavor, get the loot, and let's be jetti
Aiyyo, check it

Well, I'll be damned if I do, damned if I don't
It's time to kick the flavor on the reel you think I won't?
And you know I come to kick the flavor too
Well, that's true, now how we do?

I gets busy, aiyyo, hon me too and that's nothin'
'Cause that's the way we do, so get ready
Because you know the deal and what's the real thing, yeah, yeah, yeah

Better get your medication 'cause it spreads on the quickness
Take notes to what's goin' on

Aiyyo, Grand Puba and Mary won't steer you wrong
Hon it's just that shit, let's get it on and on and on, and on and on
Aiyyo, some try to flow but they just can't do it
But you know how that go, ain't nothin' to it

But to do it, run right through it
Those who know the time, already knew it
I drink a snapple and I wet my Adam's apple
And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor

Quick to make a buck 'cause it's not beginner's luck
Type of shit that hits when you pump it in your truck
Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike and Tina Turner
Sonny or Cher, it's somethin' dope on your ear

So whether Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, it don't make a matter
This is the type of shit to make the pockets fatter
It's simply splendid, the way that we bend it
But it's time for me to jet, so I'm a let Mary end it

You know, you know, I know
Puba knows how to flow got it goin' on

I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my suite
How have you been?
Your so nice but tonight
We're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Don't you feel the magic
The mystery's in the air
Lets go down to lover's lane
With the love we shared

Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had
Let's make the time tonight
While the feelings right
Reminisce on the love we had

I can see you standing there alone
Like an angel
Tryin' to find his way home
I don't remember how we fell apart
Here we are again, come on
Right into my heart
I recall the days in ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Don't you feel the magic
The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane

Cause I'm horny and nasty
If I see some rugged joint
Then I won't let it pass me
I take no shorts
let suckers step up and see
I'll flip the script and get harder than Jepordy
I shot the sheriff and the motherfuckin' deputy
Test me
Check it
I'm not Keith Sweat but bet that ass
That I can make it last

They end up catching whip lash

Ghas me up, get me drunk and hit the the skinz and scram

I'm not havin' that, No I'm not havin' that
You gotta do a lot more and that's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't runnin' up in me
I need a man who's lookin' out with some security
So come correct with some respect and then we will see
So if you with it, the drop the 7 digits
And I might just give you a call
If you ain't with it, then don't waste you time at all
So what's the 411, hun?

I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real

I can be your all in all

And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'Cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years a fool of a wife
I shoulda have left your ass a long time ago

Well I'm not gon cry,
I'm not gon cry,
I'm not gon shed no tears
No, I'm not gon cry,
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not gon cry,
I'm not gon cry,
I'm not gon shed no tears
No, I'm not gon cry,
It's not the time,
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not gon cry,
I'm not gon cry,
I'm not gon shed no tears
No, I'm not gon cry,

Well I'm not gon cry,

I'm not gon shed no tears
No, I'm not gon cry,
It's not the time,
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health 'till death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side

to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again

Sharing love beyond the bed

In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me

Mary J. Blige,"Fabolous, Funk Flex Vol. 4 niggas see'mon
It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls
Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson
It's Brooklyn by me the crook the I-B ya even look
At ID you gettin' hooked to I-V

Mary J. Blige,"Believe me, when I say
Before light, there was dark

Where you going, where you going?
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?

Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse
Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end (what, love)
Hold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hottest you ever been, I was that in eighty nine
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
Got to keep it real with me
If I don't know where I'm coming from
So to hell with you
Where would I go?
Now where am I going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
I think I'm going to the top
Where would I go?
Me and DMX

I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grind
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Lighter side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
Stayed far, but when they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh
Come on

If I don't know where I'm coming from
If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
But I know where I'm going
Where would I go?
I know where I'm going
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Do you know, do you know
Where would I go?

I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love, but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs
That I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill them
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood

Now what's the moral to this story?

Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
I don't know
Where would I go?
But I know where I'm coming from
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Do you know where you're coming from?
Where would I go?

Mary J. Blige,"As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man

He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses blurred my sight
I used to love him but now I don't

I used to love him but now I don't
I chose a road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen

Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
Torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated

For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone

And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Father you saved me and showed me that life

Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets deeper than oceans
My soul was weary but now it's replenished

Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul

And totally let my creator control
The life which was his to begin with
I used to love him but now I don't",I Used to Love Him,1998

It""s just some kind of thing I'm goin through
Goin' through, goin' through

Me and you, me and you
But I dream about it every night, baby
Wantin' you here with me
Makin' love to me

No no no
And I dream about you all the time
Touchin' and kissin' me

You want to hear it
I want to say from the bottom of my heart

From a distance

A message to God

Since you finishin' 'em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin' why
Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein' him leave, or watchin him go

If you wonder why (why I live my life)
The way that I do ('cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (don't worry, don't worry worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper

You'se a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play 'em like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
To straight breakin down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit' you

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I'm the type that have to shed blood
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs
Fled from the cops 'till when my first joint dropped
I'm still wit my hood, Hollow Point still in the glock
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just gettin' on
So I turned cold, givin 'em hard dick and straight to the hole
Like Rod Strickland, it was takin' it's toll
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hotty to bone
Does she love Escobar, or love Nasir Jones?
Let me know so I could cop her the stones

{Prodigy}
First of all we the one and only
Infamous and Mary Blige
Coming straight, ghetto poetry
And ain't nothing changed but the size of the money
I'm still that same 'g'
Can you say the same thing?

{Havoc}
Must be blind to the fact Mary Queen on the wax
We the kings on the streets
Ain't know where your heart at, look inside
And you'll find a entertainer, one of a kind
That's way ahead of her time
Take a look

{Mary}
Oh I need to know
If you can get into my mind
Stimulate it
Give me good love all the time
Or are you just another man
Who's after me for all my paper
Looking for a ride that's free

{1 - Mary}
Deep inside I wish you'd see
That I'm just plain old Mary
Deep inside I wish you'd see
That I'm just plain old, plain old Mary J. Blige

{Mary}
Now you see for seven years I lived life openly
So it's hard to find someone who really knows me
So I say these things just so that you can know
That you can't be with me
If you're trying to change my flow

{Mary}
Now if you take away the house
And you take away the clothes I wear
And you take away the diamonds
I'mma still be standing here
And if you take away the voice and the money
I will always be my nigga's favorite honey
And if you take away the car I drive
I'mma still be Mary Blige

{Repeat 1}

{Prodigy}
Let's separate the bullshit from the truth
Straight up, I ain't got time for new friends, I need paper
We came up from the trenches
It was like pulling teeth without sedation
From the benches to the Bentley seats
Nigga, we the M-O-be	-be	
What, you ain't heard? You can't see?
Ever since the cash they wanna hound P
Oh now you got L-O-V-E for me

{Havoc}
Doing this for about a decade Mobb and Mary
Troopers in the game with a heavy load to carry
After all the trials and tribulations
Rumors we faced, the media invading our space
That's the price you gotta pay
Take away by signs of whips
I'mma just plain old me at the end of the day
You can say what you choose
God gonna see me through
Criticize all you want 'till your face turn blue
I know you see

{Mary}
If you take away the house
And you take away the clothes I wear
And you take away the diamonds
I'mma still be standing here
And if you take away the voice and the money
I will always be my nigga's favorite honey
And if you take away the car I drive
I'mma still be Mary Blige

That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

More than I love life itself",I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues,2000

Mary J. Blige,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed,2001

From my life others shall learn a lesson.
Want a leader with the world on my shoulder
Age is young but my mind is much older.
Living up to everyone's expectations
Condemned me to a world of damnation.
I gotta clear these voices from my head,
All these opinionated noises.
Listen to the voice of my creator,
Opens doors to a path much greater;
On this path, the days draw nearer
When I can be happy, finally happy.
Searching for my destiny,
I search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Searching for my destiny,
Search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Time to broaden my horizons,
Come out from the dark and open up my eyes and
Start to define my destiny,
Experience what life can really be.
No longer concerned with your opinion,
Over my life I have dominion.
I'm stronger now than before.
I'm sure I can be so much more.
Not what you thought I would be,
Cause I'm gonna be happy, yeah,
I'm gonna be happy,
Finally, you see. . .
Searching for my destiny,
I search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Searching for my destiny,
Search for what makes me happy,
Lost in what others thought of me.
I've gotta be happy, finally happy.
Searching for what makes me me.
I gotta be so happy.
See, I gotta please me and me first.
How can I love you, 
And anyone for that meaning,
If I don't know who I am?
If I don't know where I stand?

Yes, I'm gonna be happy. . .",Destiny,2001

Mary J. Blige,"No more invisible speechless, deaf and blind child
With neglected pleasures being addicted to denial
Floating through time, gravitating towards a warm arm
With an appetite for the emptiness that promises no harm

No more uncontrollable eruptions of emotional depression
A primal S.O.S. from the barren prison of selfless expression
that only the guilty with the innocent
Souls-know buried in social scar tissue of defective ego

No more relentless sifting through bodies seeking self
Settling through competitive combat for what's left on the shelf.
A mad melee of supply and demand driven by gullible pride that
leads to sedating the you that suffocates inside

No more - forever no more, because I've unshut my eyes
And the differences between God's word and Man's Wills was realized
Seeing opposing parallel lives some liquid, other frozen. Let me to never
seek from man what God has chosen.

Then the negative whispering subsided and the panicking ceased
the undercurrent suppression of pent-up terror was released as the
mystery of the unknown manifested pristine clear A positive message
of truth entered my ear

Now, across my face is a brand new smile
With a newly revealed meaning of a ""Destine Child""
A message of hope is being released from my Heart
And I am overwhelmed with dedication to do my part

All I ever wanted was to be as I once was - Unbounded
Somehow it got all twisted and before long sounded
As though life was continuous connive-thrive-drive
Choking out the simple joy of just being alive

Now I am filled with love and I sing a love song
A song for yesterday, today, tomorrow, and beyond
My new prayer is, Thank You God for setting Me Free",Forever No More - Poem,2001
Mary J. Blige,"In the meantime, what do you do
When there's no one left but you
And you're alone
How do you feel when the one you love
Doesn't, doesn't seem real
Do you run, or do you try to heal
The hurt inside
But oh, but in the meantime

[1 - ]I have found within myself
Everything I need to get by

There is no need for you to fear
For I am here, I'll be right here
All of your life
And I am willing and able to pull you
Pull you through, through the storm
That might await you on the outside
And all of your fears and your doubts will no longer exist
Because God has granted you the greatest wage
And He's done the same for me
'cause right now, you're all I need

Some come around me try to call my bluff
Pushing my buttons just to see if I'm tough
Behind my back spreading all kind of lies
Cause your an agent working on both sides
Hanging around me trying ta get some shine
Your mad at me because I work for mine
Plus sweat and tears just to make a dime
While you sit back and try to take what's mine

[Chorus]
Don't let em push you to the limit 'cause they like it a lot
And if they keep pushing just tell em ta just keep it moving
(Keep it moving) keep it moving yeah
For you and your partner can keep hating on me
And I'm sorry that you feel this way but you can just
Keep it moving (keep it moving) keep it moving yeah

[Verse 2]
Spiritually, mentally, physically
I'm trying my best to better myself and no one else
But your so busy thinking that this money is gonna turn
Me ta someone else and settle for less
Get your own life, on your own time, stop hanging around
Trying ta drain me dry
I've been broke before,I can't do it no more, but if I have to
It won't be over you
No one in this world can make me self-destruct

Start lovin' me

Now it's time to move
Cause I'm sick and tired of playin' the fool
Cause you play to lose 
And I play to win
Tried not tosin'
Treid to be your friend
Like every other girl 
Never sexed your friends
But it's over now
And you saying, ""How?""
I found something new
That worth the while
Instead of messin' with a bump cat poster child
But I'm focused now
People saying, ""Wow!""
In place of a frown on my face, a smile
You must be out yo mind
I have no time to get you ready for a love of a lifetime

Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So bye your happiness

Only god knows where the story is
For me, but I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whatever we win or loose
And I choose to win

I grew up as a 70's baby
Brought up in poverty and sin
Makin' jokes at the crazy lady
Never acred how she was dealin' within
I knew all the words to
Micheal Jackson's album as a kid
And when it came to the biggest crusher
No he wasn't my man
At the age of seven years old
A strange thing happened to me
Before I even saw
My life had flashed before me
And I've got the mark to show
And it became a thing of beauty
So I gotta let you know
That my life, that my life

From all the sights that I've seen
From abusin' the hole in trust

Gotta change our state of life, keep it worth livin'
God gave us voices to speak and that's our way of givin'
It's so much bigger than the furs and the jewels

What about givin' back what about unifying
Shit we all black get it together

Learn to change the negative to positive situations
Don't hold the lessons that you learn

After two more drinks, we'll be feelin' the sound

Get off the wall 'cause I know that you can feel me
Stop the fronting and dance for me
So come one, come all, come everyone
And me and you, all of us, by the way we party
And you know that we're gonna put it down
After four more drinks we'll be fallin' down

Leave all your troubles and your cares behind
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, not tonight, no
Don't drink too much because we have all night
Don't you rush because it's all night long

Yeah, yeah, yo
Party time, pull the Linx out, get the minks out
Or come ghetto, but just dance to the music
Feel the vibe, I'll throw up your hands and loose it
You say you ball 'till you fall
Well it's your chance to prove it
You on hand 'till the sun up
And the pounds of smoke, bottles is empty
And I got them models in the Bentley
And six simply when I bounce in the club
Around thugs that smoke ounces of blunt
Cop cases of Cris', pop 'till they can't taste the shit
But hell, what's the major event
Real niggas, real broads, ill cars, hot rims
Sedan Coupes, SUV's, to the drop Benz
From the outside in, the party rock
We just started and we ain't tryin' to hardly stop
From the Bellvedere to the Bacardi shots Just dance ma, 'cause you know the bar hot",Dance for Me Featuring Common,2001

Well I understand that)

It's been hard for me
Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

It's been hard for me
Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

I grew up as a 70's baby
Brought up in poverty and sin
Makin' jokes at the crazy lady
Never cared how she was dealin' within
I knew all the words to
Micheal Jackson's album as a kid
And when it came to the biggest crusher
No he wasn't my man
At the age of seven years old
A strange thing happened to me
Before I even saw
My life had flashed before me
And I've got the mark to show
And it became a thang of beauty
So I gotta let you know
That my life, that my life

It's been hard for me
Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

Now mama's workin' hard all day
And she said this before she left home
Take care of your little brother
Have the place cleaned when I get home
All these priorities
Me and Tanya had to learn to be grown
But at the time for me
Being grown had seemed so lone
Woke up and I'm seventeen
With nothing going for me
Except the fact that I sing
You know it hurts so much
From all the sights that I've seen
From abusin' the hole in trust
You probably couldn't take some of things
That I've lived in my life

It's been hard for me
Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

Trying strugglin' in the streets
But where I've been- Is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

It's hard and the street's a jungle (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
Especially with your pretty colors (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
So stay low and keep it humble (I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
Black women hold it down, keep your feet on the ground
Black men keep searching and you'll be found

And where I'm going- Is not where I'm stoppin' at

In this world of continuous bullshit and full clips
Seems all we have to pass down is being useless
Broken homes, babies all alone, parent's never there
No food, no clothes to wear, anger everywhere
Ain't no values being taught, no productive thoughts
Jealousy rules the world, take shit at any cost
Gotta change our state of life, keep it worth livin'
God gave us voices to speak and that's our way of givin'
It's so much bigger than the furs and the jewels
What about encouragin' the youth to do well
What about givin' back- what about unifying
Shit we all black- get it together
Everybody's got their trials and tribulations
Learn to change the negative to positive situations
Don't hold the lessons that you learn
Pass it on and except the blessings that could earn

It's been hard for me

Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel- that can't soar, can't fly
And I imagine the Lord knows why


I feel like an angel in my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord let me in
And through all the passion and the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin' (yeah)

And for those that can't take it, stand up

Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody

I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous, tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty
Middle fingers up and say ""Fuck the world""
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out

Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come through
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to
Cause I'ma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB

Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
Fuck is she comin wit me

Chin checks if it get hectic

Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case

Can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray
You'll never go away
I promise I will try
Until the day I die

How they never have what you went there for

See what I saw just wasn't right
Yes what's done in darkness gon' come to light
But if you won't tell, I won't tell
Just let me leave before I go to jail

Mary J. Blige,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds

Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Mary J. Blige,"So burgundy, the window to his soul
It seems he tapes his eyes closed,
From huffin' on, that's what he's puffin on.
His style is rough, he wears his hair in cornrows,
His jeans hang loose and low
So his di, opps he can't be comfortable I mean, he's gotta be comfortable.

Now she's the type that's compared to a rose that grew from the concrete,
So sweet ya know,
From the streets yo.
Now she's the opposite of he,
Have you ever seen a lion sleep on the bosom of a sheep?
It's beautiful.
Yeah thug though.

[Chorus]
She's so beautiful and he's a thug,
They're so different yet they're in love.
He's so thugged out and she's so beautiful,
They're so perfect cause they're in love.

Picture this, his warm velvet voice on a cold winters night,
Sugar free, bitter truth.
Building life from a slang so divine.
Soul to soul, their flesh pressed,
From a firm of onyx tenderness.
He signed his name with a venom kiss,
Upon a heart, I never heard of such bliss.

Now she's the opposite of he,
Such as a butterfly and he's a killer bee.
Yeah, she becomes a victim to his sting,
And he's amazed by the colors of her wings.
And the life he's led has left him with some scars,
But, she viewed them all as mid-beauty marks.
The moral of the story, plain as can be,
He loved her cause, He is me.

[Chorus: x2]

Da Da-da-da da da da-da-da da

She's beautiful and he's a thug,
Made for each other 'cause they're in love.
She's a petal and he's a thorn,
From a different type of story since they were born.

You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But there was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind

When you let go
Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So bye your happiness

Only god knows where the story is
For me, but I know where the story begins

Whatever we win or loose
And I choose to win

knowin' he doin' you dirty
Why won't you just cut this guy lose?

You better than that
And you Mariah Carey, remember?

Shit!

Yet another early mornin'
and you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See I, know you seen me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead

Let me take a breath (let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you f'ed up it's over
'Cause when it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

It's a wrap for you boy (it's a wrap)
Oh, baby

If I ever misrepresented my self-image
Then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent
But I learn my lesson
Boy, you're sorry
Buh buh buh
All out in the open
Go make me go call Maury Povich

Let me take a breathe (let me take a breathe)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time
If you f'ed up it's over
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

Oh, baby

Put all of your shit in the elevator
It's going down like a denominator
Trying to keep holding on, holding on
Boy, let me go
You gonna wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot, you ain't coming back
It's the Martini I mean it baby

When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

When you need me, I care for you like you care for me
Please believe me, if I was locked up I know you'd be the one to come see me

You're my heart, I need you to live

I can't believe that you're still playing silly games
Now why do I put up w/ all this child's play

Then you ain't worth a damn thing

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

You're the worst
I can't even depend on you
you say a lot of good things
But something else you always do
Be a man of your word
Try to love something other than you
But now you can be on your way

Bout the kids

Who the fuck you really is

Broke down my wall and you got in my mind

All the signs I was wrong
Believed what I saw
And your cover was blown
Breakup, leave
Make up, please
You's a magician all them tricks up your sleeve
Had me for a minute
I was in it
you played good
But I'mma get you
I'mma make moves
And I'mma leave you where you at dog, chill
Go back to square one
Wait for something real

Could have helped you nigga
Usually know betta but I felt you nigga
I guess getting in my head was a part of the plan

Why do I beg to belong
How can you doubt that I care
When I'm with you everywhere

And you create the sweetest place
That I could ever be

That explains everything you gain

Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Whenever your memory feeds my soul, whatever got broken becomes whole
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together

Wherever I lay me down, wherever I put my head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name

Whenever those dark clouds hide the moon
Whenever this world has gotten so strange
I know that something's gonna change
Something's gonna change

Whenever I say your name,
Whenever I say your name,
I'm already praying, I'm already praying
I'm already filled with a joy that I can't explain
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying

Whenever this world has got me down, whenever I shed a tear
Whenever the TV makes me mad, whenever I'm paralyzed with fear
Whenever those dark clouds fill the sky, whenever I lose the reason why
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together

Whenever the sun refuse to shine, whenever the skies are pouring rain
Whatever I lost I thought was mine whenever I close my eyes in pain
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name

Whenever this dark begins to fall
Whenever I'm vulnerable and small
Whenever I feel like I could die
Whenever I'm holding back the tears that I cry

Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face
I'm already praying
Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I'm forced to lie awake and have to weep
Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying

Whenever I say your name,
No matter how long it takes,
One day we'll be together

wit me on this one uh
Uh

Check it
As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God I'm hot as the water 
Like a preacher who's sinned
I'm only human but
The world has put me on a platform 
since the day I was born
To only wait for my downfall 
but like a brick wall I'm too hard to brake
Ok I do make mistakes
But I'm the realest from the fake
that's why I'm the hardest to hate
I live baby girl I've learned to love those while ther still awake
Sleep Sleep 
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa
Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No.1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader a teacher I gotta
Like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers
Like a preist with a back slider
I've sinned but I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again

Check it
See I don't want to say that this is the end
I'll end by saying this is where we?ll begin
Hip hop is a freedom of expression, not a freedom of depression

Can I make my one suggestion?
Look at how we?re labeled gangsta rappers
Is that their only impression? WAKE UP!
Rappers are craft art in a rapper?s sport

Someone like a game of basketball can't be taught
But yet we accept the name thug
Like that's fly
See how they covered our eyes?

Give us names to separate us
Sit back and watch us beef and make us hate us! SAY WHAT!?!?!
