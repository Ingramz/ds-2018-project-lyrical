Louis Prima & His Band,"You won't be satisfied until you break my heart,
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start!
I tried to shower you with love and kisses,
But all I ever get from you is,
Naggin' and braggin'
My poor heart is saggin'

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame,
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same!
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart,
Oh you won't be satisfied until you break my heart!

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame,

Louis Prima & His Band,"I love to go a-wandering
Along the mountain track
And as I go, I love to sing
My knapsack on my back

Val-deri, val-dera

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha
Val-dera
My knapsack on my back

I love to wander by the stream
That dances in the sun
So joyously it calls to me
Come join my happy song

Val-eri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha
Val-era
Come join my happy song

I wave my hat to all I meet
And They wave back to me
And blackbirds call so loud and sweet
From ev'ry green wood tree

Val-eri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera

Oh, may I go a-wandering
Until the day I die
Oh, may I always laugh and sing
Beneath God's clear blue sky

Val-eri, val-dera
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Beneath the clear blue sky

And Harry's wild about me!
The heav'nly blisses of his kisses,
Fills me with ecstasy!

Louis Prima & His Band,"All of me, why not take all of me?
Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I'll never use them
Take my arms, I want to lose them

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart

Louis Prima & His Band,"Each morning a missionary advertise with neon sign 
He tells the native population that civilization is fine 
And three educated savages holler from a bongo tree 
That civilization is a thing for me to see

So bongo, bongo, bongo I don't want to leave the Congo 
Oh no no no no no 
Bingle, bangle, bungle I'm so happy in the jungle I refuse to go 
Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords 
I make it clear 
That no matter how they coax him 
Yeeeah, I'll stay right here

I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed 
Magazine? What happens? 
I see how people who are civilized bang you with automobiles 
You know you can get hurt that way Daniel 
At the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to see 
What do they see Danny?) 
Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me

So bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't want to leave the Congo 
Oh no no no no no 
Bingle, bangle, bungle he's so happy in the jungle he refuse to go 
Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis 
Noise in my ear 
So no matter how they coax him 
Yeeeah, I'll stay right here

They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train 
And though it's smoky and it's crowded 
They're too civilized to complain 
When they've got two weeks vacation 
They hurry to vacation ground 
What do they do Danny? 
They swim and they fish,
But that's what I do all year round 

So bongo, bongo, bongo I don't want to leave the congo 
Oh no no no no no 
Bingle, bangle, bungle I'm so happy in the jungle I refuse to go 
Don't want no jailhouse, 
Shotguns, 
Fish hooks, 
Golf clubs, 
I got my spears 
So no matter how they coax him 
Yeeeah, I'll stay right here

They have things like the atom bomb 
So I think I'll stay where I a-a-m

Louis Prima & His Band,"When you look at me that way, I must believe the things you say,
Why, if you told me night was day, I wouldn't doubt it.
Baby, if you told me that the world I thought was round, was flat,
Not one of my eyelids would bat, I'm easily touted.
But when it comes to matters of the heart,
I, and my belief in you, just part

I kind of believed you when you said your nights were lonely,
Til the day that I came by.
But when you whisper'd that I was your one and only 
That was a big fat lie.

I should have been wiser than I was and seen right through you,
But the moon got in my eye.
That stuff about ""I never lived until I knew you"" 
That was a big fat lie.

You must have started to fib when you were wearing a bib,
And such a habit's hard to break.
A little lie is OK, but when you lie night and day,
That's more than even I can take.

You told me we ought to marry and I let you sway me,
Kissed my happy days goodbye,
And when you told that man you'd honour and obey me 
That was a big fat lie 
An over exaggeration of a super prevarication of a  big fat lie!",That Was a Big Fat Lie,1999

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

That's the time the festive chink starts to wink his other eye, 
Starts to wink his dreamy eye, lazily you'll hear him sigh.

See that broken wall street sport, still thinks he's a millionaire. 
Still thinks he's a millionaire, pipe dreams banish ev'ry care.

Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees
Yo ho it's hot, the sun is not a place where we could live
But here on earth there'd be no life without the light it gives

We need its light, we need its heat, we need its energy
Without the sun, without a doubt, there'd be no you and me
The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees

The sun is hot
It is so hot that everything on it is a gas

The sun is large
If the sun were hollow, a million earths could fit inside
And yet the sun is still only a middle-sized star

The sun is far away
About 93,000,000 miles away, and that's why it looks so small
And even when it's out of sight, the sun shines night and day

The sun gives heat, the sun gives light, the sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy

Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine
The heat and light of the sun come from the nuclear reactions
Of hydrogen,carbon, nitrogen and helium

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

Louis Smith,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

And now I sit and wonder night and day

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.

But no one is waiting any more,

I love to look in your eyes
This can't be love
Because I feel so well

No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs

Louis Stewart,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Louis Stewart,"You give me your lips and your lips are so heavenly,
Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,
So does the moon in the blue,
All this is mine and heaven too.

You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

You give me your love and your love is a melody,
Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine
And heaven too.",All This and Heaven Too,2007

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Louis Stewart,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2007

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken

Louis Tomlinson,"Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I’m taking?
All the smiles that I’m faking
Everything is great
Everything is fucking great

Going out every weekend
Staring at the stars or the ceiling
Hollywood friends, got to see them
Such a good time
I believe it this time

Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We’re dancing on tables
'Til I’m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn’t get better they say

We’re singing ‘'til last call
And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits you when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

Just like that and I’m sober
I’m asking myself, is it over?
Maybe I was lying when I told you
“Everything is great
Everything is fucking great”

And all of these thoughts and the feeling
Doesn’t matter if you don’t need them
I’ve been checking my phone all evening
Such a good time
I believe it this time

And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits you when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

Now I’m asking my friends how I should say I’m sorry
They say “Lad, give it time, there’s no need to worry”
And we can’t even be on the phone now
And I can’t even be with you alone now

Oh how, shit changes
We were in love
Now, we’re strangers
When I feel it coming up I just throw it all away
Get another two shots 'cause it doesn’t matter anyway

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

Louis Van Dyke,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Pierre Benoît ou Paul Morand ?
Penses-tu trouver dans leurs livres
De quoi rêver des nuits des jours
Quand le plus beau roman d'amour
Nous sommes entrain de le vivre
N'avons-nous pas assez lutté
Pour vivre ensemble et nous aimer ?
Ferme les yeux, recueille-toi...
Car tu sais aussi bien que moi

Refrain:

Un amour comme le nôtre
Il n'en existe pas deux
Ce n'est pas celui des autres,
C'est quelque chose de mieux
Sans me parler
Je sais ce que tu veux me dire...
A mon regard
Tu vois tout ce que je désire...
Pourquoi demander aux autres
Un roman plus merveilleux ?
Un amour comme le nôtre
Il n'en existe pas deux.

Je sais, les romans c'est certain,
T'emmènent en des pays lointains
Sous des ciels bleus, de clairs rivages...
Oui, mais là-bas qu'y trouve-t-on ?
Des rues, des taxis, des maisons...
Chérie, méfie-toi des mirages...
Tiens, regarde notre intérieur
Des livres, des chansons, des fleurs
Et mes deux bras pour te bercer...
Et mon coeur pour toujours t'aimer...

Learn to let the feelings show

Someone who really loved me
Won't make the same mistake,
This time I'll never let you go

Show me how you feel in every way
Show me how you feel

I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh

I tossed my heart into the wind
I had thrown all hope away
That love would ever let me in

That breaks through the long, cold night
You brought in a brand new morning sun

Reminds me of when, oh yeah, we were together
All the things you and I used to do
Reminds me of you, yeah

We must have talked for hours
I guessed we put the world to right, yeah

You drove me crazy
You drove me home at night
I never wanted to say goodbye

Wasn't real or make believe
Heaven knows, I can't forget

Floating down the Nile in serious style

When I woke up so surprised to see
That I had become an Egyptian Queen

I don't wanna stop this dreaming
I just wanna keep believing

'Cause I had a dream, I was an Egyptian Queen
Floating down the Nile in serious style
I thank the sun for making you my king
And I never wanna wake up from this dream

In my adventure you're holding me
My Egyptian God, you're my Ramses
And we'll get lost in this mystery
To the big romance, won't you come with me?

I don't wanna stop this dreaming
I just wanna keep believing
This dream will never go away
Not even in the light of day

Can I be your own Egyptian Queen?

Let me be your own Egyptian Queen

Louise,"Once, there were stars out in the night
That never seemed to shine
And love was there for every heart
Seemed every heart but mine

That's how it seemed to be
Then, darling, you changed everything
Just when I thought I'd given up
Out walked loneliness

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

I tossed my heart into the wind
I had thrown all hope away
That love would ever let me in
And then, you came my way

Just like a ray of light
That breaks through the long, cold night
You brought in a brand new morning sun
Out walked loneliness

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh

And now, I feel
How it feels to feel alive
Just one touch and I knew
And I knew

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
In walked love, right through my door

Oh, I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh

Got until it's gone
It's easy to forget the beauty in someone
Taking them for granted,
You're with them everyday
Little by little the love slips away

When you love someone
Really love somebody
You've got to learn,
Learn to let the feelings show
Once I had someone,
Someone who really loved me
Won't make the same mistake,
This time I'll never let you go

I'm gonna give you my undivided loving baby
I want you body, mind, heart and soul
Come on and give me your
Undivided loving baby
You'll taste the sweetest love
You've ever known

Think of all you've done for me
Words can not express
The joy I feel inside you bring
Me such happiness
Working through the day
With one thing on my mind
I can't wait to be alone with you tonight

When you love someone, really love somebody
Show me how you feel in every way
Show me how you feel
Show me that you need me
Hold me close, promise me you'll stay

Louise Bush,"Moana, make way, make way!
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is
All you need

The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need)

This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do (make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need

We share everything we make (we make)
We joke and we weave our baskets (aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see

Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are

Consider the coconut (the what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers (we make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (the water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside (we cook up the meat inside)

Consider the coconuts (consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves (ha!)
The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are

You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
You must find happiness right
Where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous (ha!)
I like how it misbehaves

The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are

We make our nets from the fibers (we weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (and we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside (we have mouths to feed inside)

The village believes in us (that's right!)
The village believes (ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together

Louise Carlyle,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Doesn't makes me a better person than I was
Even if to have you, it's too late

It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe,

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's, it's de-lovely"".",It's De-Lovely,1995
Louise Gold,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic

Louise Gold,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows

Because the Western folks all know
He's a highfaluting, scooting, shooting son-of-a-gun from Arizona

Louise Morrissey,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me.

Louise Pitre,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All,2001

Louise Rhodes,"Here's all I really know of this life
Love's all we have to give
Seems like the more I struggle on this earth
The more completely I'm in
In a world where mediocrity rules
Bodies collide without a moment of emotion
Scant parts running high behind closed minds
And we all lose our way
Let me be, let me be the moon and stars for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Let me be, let me be the sun and moon for you
Let me be your sky of blue
The winter clouds are stalking up on me
Packing the sun away
Darkness is creeping up on all our dreams
To wipe them clean away
Building boxes around our lives
Compartments for each and every feeling
Freedom lost with our innocence
Forgotten long ago.
Let me be, let me be the moon and stars for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Let me be, let me be the sun and moon for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Your sky of blue.
That's all I really know of this life
Here's what I want to be
Seems like the more I wander on this earth
The more I'm after me

One part's necessary in open minds
And we won't lose our way",Azura,1998

I'm wasting my time

Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was,

Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.

To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

Life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was

Rather well preserved,
The wrinkles didn't show.

Louise Tobin,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

Louise Weekley,"As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power
It's waiting waiting in the gloom
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Borne on the air, the screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross

Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture

And the master is calling your name
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?
Does the talisman protect you from pain?

The deluge breaks, the tempest roars
But in the storm my spirit sing
Oh shelter me Lord underneath Your wing
Shelter me Lord underneath Your wing
Now on the day, You call for me
Someday when time, no more shall be

Oh shelter me Lord, underneath Your wings!

Happy golden days of yore

Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Can we pick up the pieces

We bringin' back the Twin Towers, 20-0-3, crack game electronic
Conceived with slow jams by The Delfonics
At a level that you should of been years ago
Responsible usually for coke traffic, usually for broken bone tragic
Rest in peace, to Mayor Guliani's term
They say I'm wrong, shit
I'm try'nna see 26, with my daughters at the Emmy Awards
All around the ball glowin', they got the weed flow droughted
Or maybe niggaz in the hood just ain't 'bout it
Talkin' Hercules, and ain't nothin' but dog food
Staten Island, New York City drools
Crazy glue on my fingerprints
Name on the concrete of my hood, what's really good?
Vendetta's with these rap stars
Frontin' like this crime and the pet is they cars
Believe I was God in my last life
What if it was your knife? What if they was your gloves, nigga..

[Chorus]

[Cappadonna]
Aiyo, I came into this game on some real love shit
And ya'll bitch ass niggaz, ya'll wanted me to quit
Because the way I dress ill and the way that I spit
But I ain't never gon' stop, droppin' these joints
And ya'll fake ass niggaz, ya'll ain't gettin' no points
Don't try to sabotage me, 'cause you just can't do it
You had me in the Square, last year, but you blew it
Big Donna from the group home, that's my word
Splash shots at your whip, splash shots at your bird
Leave your brains and your Gucci boots up on the curb
Pillage for life, Allah's will be the most superb
Smoke weed with the cannon, smoke the herb
So bow down, all you crab ass clowns you can't live
My gun's on empty, but it's more shots to give
I pop you like a slave cop, run in your crib
Throw darts at your wife, throw darts at your kid
Leave your house flooded with hits like O.J. did
Escapin' the crime scene and you love how I slid

But if you'll only hear me out
Might I make a suggestion?

Don't ask questions.

Through what we can't say

Love and Rockets,"Thinking of your private future
You snatched at the trees
In the starry dark green sleep
Thinking of your private future
You think at the river and set it flowing
A late fog's lifting a fast wind's rising
So you turn to reflect on your brief life
Session slip

Thinking of your private future
Cut by the scars of timeless coming back
Realize the unreachable is nothing
Cool winds wash down your hope and you slipped
Cool winds wash down your hope and you slipped

God's good to the humble
As the devil is to fools
Stop looking back in anger
Cause you can't change the rules
Believe in where you're going
But don't lose your yesterdays
To terrify to cry its true
Your life is just a game

So I need a million dollars
To sit on mountain tops
To see the stars surround you
Is to see an awful lot
I see the work of sinners
I see the work of saints
So I see the work of everyone
That's ever ever been

Sleep without reason
Your laughing masks your love
You've got so many scars 
How does it feel deep in your heart?

Cause when the covers blown over
It'll crack up your skin
So now you're drowning your sorrows
In whiskey and sin

Live the life you love
In the god you trust
And don't take it all to seriously

And you're the dumbest **** this city's ever seen
He was laughing, shaking, high up in a tree
But then he lost his balance and he fell down on his knees

So I leapt on that mother my anger to appease
When I grabbed him by the throat, he said ""Oh spare me please""
Sure as gullible as my name I let him go back to the trees
And straight away the poisons flowing freely from the keys

The sky is grey and the grass unseen
And he's still the dumbest **** this concrete jungle's ever seen
That mother he was laughing, bathing in the heat
But then he slipped again and landed in the street

Deep down in the city 'neath the concrete trees
Nobody's seen that mother high in the fleas
But there's a new one in the obituaries 
And it shows four stars where the name oughta be

Had a dream...

I was riding on a train that wasn't bound for glory
Riding on a train, the train was bound for hell
Riding on a train that wasn't bound for glory, that's for sure
Riding on a train that's bound for hell

The engine with human blood was damp
The headlight was her brimstone lamp
And then for fuel I shoveled in bones
and the furnace roared with a thousand groans

The tank was filled with lager beer
The devil himself was engineer
The passengers were a mixed up crew
The churchman in his battered suit

The rich in broadcloth, poor in rags
Handsome girls, wrinkled hags
Black men, yellow, red and white
Chained together, fearful sight

The dream was storming at full pace
The sulfer fumes burned hands and face
Wilder and wilder the country grew
Faster and faster the engine flew

Loud and terrible thunder crashed
Whiter brighter lighing flash
Hotter still the air became
So clothes will burn from each shrinking frame

There came a fearfull ear-splitting yell...
Yell Satan: ""dance, the next stop's hell""
Twas then the passengers shrieked with pain
And begged the devil to stop the train
Stop this train

He shrieked and roared, and grinned with glee
And mocked and laughed at their misery
""My friends you've bought your seats on this road,
I've got to get through with a complete load""

You've pulled in the weak, you've cheated the poor
You starving tramp, you turned from the door
You've up gold till your purses bust
You've give a beastly lust

You've mocked at god in your hellful pride
You've killed and you've cheated, and plundered and lied
You've come across men and you've swore and you've stole
Not a one in body and soul
Body and soul

So you've paid full fare and I'll carry you through

If there's one 

And here's a time when I ain't no liar

A land that will save you, a land of fire

And your flesh will scorch in the flames that roar

You'll sizzle and burn from



And I awake with a thrilling cry

My were clothes were wet, my hair stood high

And I prayed as I've never until that hour

To be saved from hell and the devil's power



At present my vows were not in vain

That I payed no fare on that hellbound train ",Bound for Hell,1989

My backs about to break, no money in the bank, and she don't call me anymore.
I'm down to my last ring, it's time to sell my things

And pack my bags, and never look back,
Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks, and make my get away.
I put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down.
Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight,
And at the break of day, I'll be a runaway!

A hundred miles in, I got a stupid grin on my scruffy face.
With every cigarette, I'm burning my regrets.
Don't want to leave a trace.
And from the rear-view, I've got clear view of who I used to be.
A little bit faster now, don't wanna turn around.

Down by the creek we would always play and tell secrets by the porch light
Shy as a bird and timid as a flower, I wonder where she grew up
I never really thought that much about it, but everybody said her daddy was the town drunk

Broken like a bottle, running from the only hole she ever had, 
Tangled in the talk behind her back
Yeah he thought she was nothing, growing like a weed on the wrong side of the tracks
How could anyone not love a girl like that

One afternoon in the middle of town I saw her daddy sleeping on a bench
So I walked up and introduced myself and said his daughter was my best friend
He looked at me like he didn't care and asked me for a couple of bucks
Right then I decided that I'd look after that pretty little girl whose daddy was the town drunk

Broken like a bottle, running from the only home she ever had, 
Tangled in the talk behind her back
