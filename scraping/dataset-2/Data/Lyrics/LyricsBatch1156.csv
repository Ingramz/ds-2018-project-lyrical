There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

My buddies tell me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian life

My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I still love them they burden my heart
I'll try to lead them to walk in the light

The Louvin Brothers,"Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray

I attended service at a little church in the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
""My God is real""
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, ""preacher, tell them that satan is real too""
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment

Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray",Satan Is Real,1960
The Louvin Brothers,"Satan's jeweled crown, I've worn it so long
But God, for my soul, has reached down
His love set me free, He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satan's jeweled crown

If I could be king and ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
I'd rather know that I have salvation
Then to know my reward is Satan's jeweled crown

Satan's jeweled crown, I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satan's jeweled crown

When I lived my life, so reckless and evil
Drinking and running around
The things I would do were the will of the devil
I was giving my soul for Satan's jeweled crown

But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me His own

The Louvin Brothers,"When the postman delivered a letter
It filled her dear heart full of joy
But she didn't know till she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
Dear Mom, was the way that it started
I miss you so much it went on
Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet
The captain just gave us our orders
And Mom, we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darling had died
That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free",Soldier's Last Letter,1962

And every Sunday evening, out in her home, I'd dwell

I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees, for mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy dear, don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying ""dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?""
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding at my nose

I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through, as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see

And missed your graduation so you say
Well it's time to find somebody new to believe in

You seem to me the type of girl that men forget
From face to face to back to bed
You spend most your time 
Walking off the letdowns

But the hardest thing for you 
Is just to let that bell ring true and everybody knows

A little rain must fall, everybody knows
A little rain must fall

Well I should be the one to talk
But I seem OK, not worth a damn or so they say
Well I wish that boy would find one thing he can believe in 

I used to be the type to cry but now I laugh 
From wall street hippie to sociopath
I spend most of my time
Walking off the letdowns

But the hardest thing to do
Is just to let that bell ring true and everybody knows

[Chorus]
A little rain must fall everybody knows
A little rain must fall but we can wait it out together
You see it never lasts forever and everybody knows
A little rain must fall

Now I know I'll find the sunshine to soothe me when I'm needy
And I know this is just a little rise in the road
And I can feel my luck is changing and it's rising up to greet me
And I can see there's just a little farther to go
Oh but right now everybody knows

Well the sun comes up in different ways in Rockwell paintings and Hemingway
Now who do you suppose those two fools believed in
Is it just a stroke of luck fat chance or is it just a matter of circumstance
Well perfection sure get's boring anyway
But tomorrow's another day 
And everybody knows

If you could side with your love and not the feeling that it's over
You'd be fine for a little while

It's been so long that I've forgotten what I'm after

Out of sight, are we out of our minds?
And the city of angels
Won't save us
But maybe we'll be famous before we die

Say goodbye
But you better be sure
Don't throw it away and pretend

North or south?
You know the east is the best

Safe inside your ceiling till the feeling takes you down south
Where everyone you meet will always have an open hand out

Young gun, your skin's started peeling
The sun's coming out
Now you've got something to believe in
You'll come back around

Separate salutes
Drawing a line through our bedrooms
Get your Breakthrough
But please hire the players you want to

And I'll just keep on singing underneath these southern doldrums
And you ascend up through the peach's pit the tip of my tongue
Even though we knew the pieces fit we've ripped them undone

The minute you let her under your skin

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her

The Love Sponge Strings,"Dad I know you were sad when you died
And I was young it's the way I kept you in my mind
The mess that was left and my mother cried
And when she stood up she was nobody's mother I'd be fine

But I missed you then
And I miss you now
Liked you'd missed things I might say
You seemed lost in clouds
But I'm older now
I can see through lifting haze
That you were away even when you were here

Sometimes a phrase or a manner that's you
Comes through me, it goes in a flash
It's a frame, it's a blink like life
Oh and how much now should we pay for the past
'Cause you could age with grace if I freed you in my mind

But I loved you then
And I love you now
All the things I wished I'd asked
When I'm lost in clouds
I remember how
I was robbed and I was blessed
And you were away even when you were here
'Cause it's not about you, not you, anymore
It's about what I'd do with it all
And I, I'll never let you let me down

This morning I wake to be older than you were
Fresh white snow for miles, every footstep will be mine
You'd have lost that weight, you'd have gone so straight

You'd have kept those wolves at bay

I had a dream, but dreams had other plans for me
For 30 years I set the thermostat
Where Frank Sinatra liked it,
Pulled his girls, and hung his hats
I never knew which one were mine
Now he's gone, and I'm alone

And I don't know where I might be going
I rode the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside coming home
But home, for me was always someone else you know
That shadows always fall, when the sun goes down

I shook the hands of mafia dons and presidents
And though they always smiled politely
With a measure of decorum
Still their eyes would scan beyond me
For a glimpse of something more
But now he's gone
Now they're gone

And I don't know where I might be going
I rode the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside coming home

Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't breathe

And someone said hey we're locking the door no time to play

I was told a little tail about a skinny as a rail

He was hung up in the desert swappin' rats
And tryin' ta get a drink of water with his knees gettin' mud caked
And I'll tell you and exceptance how he stumbled into Memphis Tennessee

Get sister run quickly to the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard; and play a guitar chord
And do a little do it yourself

And come and play the hardware in time

Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy
He was surfin' when he hit me but jumped off his board to get me
And he dragged me by the armpit like a child's toy

A few frozen dinners ago
When I stumbled on a waiter full of crêpe suzettes
And I ran out the door flambeau

Then I ran down to Chinatown got myself some soy sauce
And grabbed some moo goo gai pan to go
When I got wiped out by a stray beansprout

And no matter where their heads are they know mom´s ain´t there
'Cause I swore when I was small that I´d remember when
I knew what´s wrong with them that I was smaller then

Determined to remember all the cardinal rules
Like sun showers are legal grounds for cutting school
I know I have forgotten maybe one or two
And I hope that I recall them all before the baby´s due
And I know he´ll have a question or two

Like ""hey Pop, can I go ride my zoom
It goes two hundred miles an hour suspended on balloons
And can I put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue
And imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs""
And I must be permissive, understanding of the younger generation

Then I´ll know that all I´ve learned my kid assumes
And all my deepest worries must be his cartoons
And still I´ll try to tell them him all the things I´ve done
Relating to what he can do when he becomes a man
And still he´ll stick his fingers in the fan

And ""Hey, Pop, my girlfriend´s only three
She´s got her own videophone and she´s taking L.S.D.
And now that we´re best friends she wants to give a bit to me
But what´s the matter Daddy, how come you´re turning green?
Can it be that you can´t live up to your dreams?""",Younger Generation,1990

It comes down from high, in its heavenly stand
Suggesting redemption, will be easily possessed
For less then any pound of flesh

To settle the score, write the record straight
So he may free his slaves, where on the death bed he lays

The rooster crawls, and daybreak is upon
As the cigarette on his lips

For God only knows how you have taken mine
And seize them clear, to the ends of time
To hold the smart smart flesh

Knowing in the end, you'll be alone
For lonely death does creep
So hire yourself, a chimney maid
And smoke yourself to sleep

Must visit the judge in a new disguise
Saying judge in your robes, oh judge so wise
There's something on your lip

In a man of his state, right before he dies
Must clear the black pages to tarnish the mind
In a bible in a bath, for mind to hide

For lonely death does creep
So hire yourself, a chimney maid
And smoke yourself to sleep

In a damp bed of the catacomb

I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

I can't help thinking about me

I remember my friends, always been found and I can't

I can't help thinking about me

The LOX,"I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?  
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what

You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me

If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats

Breathin', eatin', the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats

There's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it, got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide

Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak

Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like

And may God bless your mom and your two children
Your wife, your family and all your friends
Everybody stay strong, the good die young
Where we from it's all wrong, we all confused

Never know what we have til what we have we lose
Think Big, we just lost a very big jewel
Hip-hop itself is at a pit-stop itself
Seeing Big die I wish the shit would stop itself

It hurts, you're probably too good for this earth
Genius at his work
Made dirty cats want to get a clean shirt
Pop Cristal and rock they ice work (word), go Big *go Big*

Everybody wanted to know Big
Made the rap biz, glitter like showbiz
Ask anybody, who could flow Big
All the cats shined, but you would glow Big

Frank White lyrically, moved niggas spiritually
Made you want to get a cup, fill it up with Hennessey

Just to let y'all know, everything is all real
But it's sad when a good fella catch a raw deal
And pain is a part of life that we all feel

Today this whole rap game is getting more ill
It make me look back, to where he took rap
Dude brought the East back, y'all better believe that
He never had a warning, One More Chance

Was right before him everybody must answer when God's calling
I flew b's wit him, I blew trees wit him
Couldn't wait to go on tour across seas wit him
People seem to get lost and, blow things out of proportion

Life is worth more than the coffin
I need answers, and they better be the truth
Hurts like a bad tooth, we losin mad youth
Lyrically there'll never be no one above you
And no matter how they judge you we always gonna love you

We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) *repeat 4X*
Right now I know you missing it, smoking in peace
After all this bullshit don't cease, huh Big
Right now, you and Pac in harmony, probably hugging

While everybody from Brooklyn to West coast is bugging
All these gang wars, Big, show me a sign
As for your son I'ma raise Shorty like he was mine (no doubt)
It seems that the devil got his stinking back whooped

And we should pray for Jesus, and ask for forgiveness
I can remember all the studio time, getting twisted
Bottle after bottle, Bacardi Lime, I miss it
We clicked like heels when we first met the

Junior Ma-f-i-a and Big Po-ppa
Nearly broke down four times writing this verse
Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts
But ain't no need to cry, cause right now, where you at

Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at
But it's sad that it takes that for us to unite
The only time you see your family is funeral night
Christopher Wallace, Frank White, holding it down

I guess you with the real king in New York now
For real

I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless
If you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle
And y'all niggas done started something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'mma makes a lot 'til you rot
And if you a player, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

Don't came at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck what you heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on yo' toe
Now who gon' tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
What's that?

Surgery with the chainsaw, I hit the fucking streets
'Cause like I said before ain't nothing going down until I eat
Motherfuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, addressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with motherfuckers on all levels
What I'm dealing with is all devils, fucking with snakes
Running wit niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine
Your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck with you
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck with you
And gave it the money
'Cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest
Then I tossed the nine, boss of crime

Hey yo, I woke up in a daze wit' the slight headache.
You know the usual, the studio gettin' red late.
Serious jet lag when I get to bed late.
That why I fuck, 'cause I be weak when I get head late.
Today I got a session wit' Ronnie, I mean Veronica. 
Met her last year, about a week before Hanukkah.
Sounds foolish, I mean, honey wasn't Jewish,
But she had a lot of dough and she was nice on computers.
She told me she was born and raised in Bermuda,
And came here to get a job as a tutor.
I pursued, make a long story short, screwed her.
She moved, and she came back, still on the same track.
Same wit' same chips, ass, it was still fat. 
I ain't really think she was a freak, 
But she did ask a lot of questions 'bout Stylez and Sheik.
She called me and said she was in town fo' a week,
The Westside, Manhattan, the Suite and the Marquise.
How I felt about gettin' up fo' old times sake.
I'm a bring Stylez and Sheik wit' me, datta be great. 
Jus' have two friends, we gon' bring the truck and the new Benz. 
Desert in the, stashin' the Sony cam, zoom lens.
All have ourselves one big hell of a weekend.
Eat at Puff's joint, an' catch a show at the beacon.
Twist a dutch blaze from Y-O to the Hudson.
Pass the tall one, two-five, we still puffin.
We got the heat on a cold night 'n the winter. 
Stylez you remember, Sheik you remember.

[Sheek]
Oh yeah, I remember them hos that night.
We was at the beacon, right?
Chris Tucker performing.
All of us was in der, outside it was stormin',
Cats and Dogs. 
hey yo, dese hos wuz tough.
Besides the air condition on high, we wuz icy enough.
From my neck to the belt buckle, to our shoes, shall I go on? 
Wit' five of us up front, he needed shades to perform.
Mose from the flow, up we inside, toe up.
I drink, they smoke, no coke.
Besides the shit he said on stage, the cash we had on us wuz no joke.
I slid fo' seats down, she sittin' there, smilin'. 
Lookin' like she from an island, not them chicks that be out wilin'. 
Told me that her name wuz Cindy,
Favorite show Mork and Mindy,
Favorite color, green, no kids, but plan to have plenty. 
We chit den chat, 'bout dis 'n dat.
From what kind of whip she push,
To what bar she be at,
She played hard to get,
But we made it from the movie to the jacuzzi, 
From the jacuzzi to the bed,
We fucked until we both got woozy.
Woke up, breath stinkin', 
Yawnin' and shit.
I smelt breakfast in the kitchen, but where was the bitch?
I walked in there, it was cheese, eggs, and grits on the table,
Wit' beef sausages and orange juice, next to the cable.
Wit' a note saying sorry, I had to rob you, baby, but 
I need cash like you, I ain't your ordinary slut,
Or dick teaser, please, I need food in my freezer.
And by the time you read dis note, I done been spent yo' Visa.

I remember Beatrice, but niggas like me call her B,	 
'Cause she like to fuck doggy style, plus hold the D. 
But now I got to handle dis 'cause they skandalous. 
Cindy robbed Shiek and moved to Los Angeles,
Like I won't kill a friends. 
Went to bounce, stole a Benz.

Y'all three rugged niggas, but y'all gotta get robbed.
Don't take it personal, we didn't finish the job.

We kill niggas wit' they dick hard.
They got me lookin' at the letta stuff. 
Why the fuck they left the truck? 
Three bitches in my house,
Probably try to wet me up.
Crept to the kitchen,
Seen Ronnie by the cabinet.
Tried the gun holster with the forty fo' Magnum,
Shot her in the heart.
Den caught the earchess fabanet.
Den I seen Cindy,
The bitch tried to end me,
Running out the living room,
Bustin' off Kissimee.
The bitch couldn't aim,
So I blew her out the frame.
Turned around to Beatrice,
Why you look speachless?
We could have lived it up and jus' fucked on the beaches, 
And now you gotta die,
And the stupid bitch is reaching.
Be'fo I cocked it back
I heard tires screeching,

Hit him on the head said there ain't no cash there

At home practicing trying to learn how we spit it
Fourty-eight hours of old tea like Nick Nolte
Young but O-G's at this rap shit nigga please
One hit for all of us to start eating
And wild stack on three weeks
on bowell leather beats
Our parents are sharp like cactus's
And you can tell by chips, we sleep on mattresses
Dimes flooded out in the hideous
Shit you see in magazines, cut
out we freak them hoes
Drop them clothes, double expose you in the lens

In the suite with this honey from Bangladesh
Pop a snapple, I ? lay on my chest
All I had to do was get it there, she doing the rest
Take a L to the head, then we listen to flex
Yes, the black hood, and I mack good

The freaky one, mom said I was soon to be done
Because I sexed more, and my career's yet to begun
But I can't help that, you bless me with they looks and pops with the yanks
So now the dimes gimme brain, and spot me faster in his hand
Sheek baby, my style been rough until Puff showed me the better things in life
And how to live phat like Biggie, so I present my shit like that
Half rough half jiggy, this part time college nigga, part time job
Had to taste the cake one time and decided to rob, and buy drugs
Caught slipping almost got Sheek plugged, Jack Daniel, dog
Shorty rushed the building with the pump out, he spit around I'm like, whoa!
I guess it was God that pushed my head down, cause I ain't know, word yo
And since then neither religious or christian, but I keep the faith in Him

Puff jerkin them anyway, but the difference is if I'm gettin jerked I'm still
Seeing noise
Push the big boy toys that fly by like zooms

Cause we lost B.I.G., but he still wit us
Fooled y'all ass, y'all tools don't blast
All we do is make hot songs and use y'all cash
I hang my plaques in the bathroom
Cause I'm sill thinking bout making a hit
While I'm taking a shit
Player Haters be scraping the 6
For no reason, that don't even make no sense
I'm happy they made them with bullet prof glass tints

Get a new look out, pull your black book out

I ain't gonna lie, If I wasn't doing this now 
I'd probably'd be tied down, in a small town 
With my eyes on a couple of guys 
With their eyes on a couple of pies 
Cause I will survive 
Brains, is the key to the game 
If you ain't got none, what good is a shotgun? 
If you ain't got guns, then you better cop some 
'Cause the New World Order's around the block, dun

They never go there, but you can blow here 
The 25 to life and greens from below 
Where, outta nowhere, you in the bus, hands is cuffed 
Can't call your Mom, dog, you know times is rough 
You was out yesterday, stressing a better way 
Funny thing, they always seem to lock down Kings 
And the thugs on the street just love to say, ""It's all foul."" 
Watch the honeys check your style 
Worthless, when they worship, what you purchase 
They only see ice, not me, under the surface 
What's the purpose? I just, go my way 
Know my way, 'till bullets blow my way 
Which they might, 'cause any night can change your life 
Keep your state of mind tight and remain alright 
It's plain to fight, but different to shoot 
And might do it 
If you ain't 10 different ways to get loot.

Hey, yo, we handle rap like we do the street 
Holding heat 
It's them same crooked niggas

To give you garbage, slide the butters to their mans 
That's aiight, though 
'Cause even ready rock gets sold on our block 
Watch us turn nothing into nitro 
And we don't mingle 
'Cause none of us don't really know you 
From the heart, we never talk to strangers 
So why start? 
Anyway, we're rapping for this luxury shit 
I watch wild niggas blow 
See how plush shit can get 
But we ain't trying to kiss ass to blow up fast 
We gonna take our time and rely strictly on the rhyme 
If I, wasn't that cat, Sheek Lucian, that rap 
Would you still be my man 
And pass your bottle to my hand 
Would I be in the rain 
While you pass me in the Land 
Oh, you think by now that I don't already know your plan 
To get next to me and possibly sex me 
Then slip Ecstasy inside a nigga's Pepsi 
Money'll never amount to respect, be	 
And you don't want to test me 
'Cause God blessed me.

The LOX,"[Chorus:]
If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know
We can get together, we could do whatever
But you can't get no doe

Yo, since the Mona video you been trackin' me down
Tryin' to figure out how I look impersonal, Baby
Forget rooks tell me can you roll with crooks
The three hot niggas rising in the Billboards, nigga
We look to change from the big lands, big bitches
Big Benz tryin' to make D-O-E and,
The thick chicks love us, big dick style niggas
Crystal niggas, y'all finesse the rich style niggas
You didn't love me when my name was Sean
Now you should see how bitches act when the Benjamins come on
But I ain't hatin' em, you gotta scream the way females play
Quick schemes and Negligie to make a clean get-away
Fly thug where the Willies stay, and she pay nothing
Stash what you heard, gifts are frontin'
I stashin' mad chips gettin' drunk up with the China
Club, while you gettin' schemed 'cause you did a minor

I know she wit it, I better pray I could hit it
Black tire fair I gotta fresh pair of British
Ice Berg shirts along with Ice with it
Turquoise, 9-11 fortune in pent
The honey got a lot of Jags, You gotta fill it
Honey gotta a lot of bags, then she went inside to find her 
Lil'Kim when she set up her choice, like my voice
My thug style made her category
That's the realist shit I heard, that's my word
? I'm the nigga she deserves
I put em on the hole in ? rockin' furs
Liftin' weights and speak without using words
If she ain't proper I still gotta drop her
Sheik don't like her, had a dream that I shot her
I can't buy you ? you get nada
I'm the bounce with the chick that be lookin' a little hotter

[Chorus]

They was never mine for me to dump em
And just like checkers, after they make a move I'm a jump em
It's like this girlfriend I'm a keep it real,
Every nigga with a deal ain't able to peel
I'm a Bad Boy so I'm cased up with whips
Guess what, I got more nuts than chips
And they gonna melt right in your mouth
Not in your hand, You know you ain't my girl
And I'm not your man
But do you still want to lick me?
Or is because I'm a ? Niggee, and I lone Biggie
And I don't mess with no fat ladies
But if you pay like you weigh then you can stay baby
We straight slide, gimme more like that
With this honey named ?, 'cause she blow like that
And when we finish don't look at me like I owe nothin'
'Cause if you really dig then let me know something

See, I want to get back to the love.
Let's start love over, come on.

[Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Let's start love over,
Back to the way things were. 
Forget about them,
'Cause all we got is us.
We can make it
Sad if we try.
I want to start love over.
Let's make it, do or die 

[Styles]
When I was nine years old,
I realized there was a road.
At the end, I would win lots of pots of gold.
Days, when I used to have my play clothes on,
I would make up my rhymes the middle of Voltron,
But you've learned what the herbs do.
Breaking curfew,
Hit the park when it's dark, make it stand like a podium.
Niggas had a box and a strip of linoleum.
Some break a boogie, but those that don't 
Was usually a fighter.
Rollin' easy riders,
Sending people to the store for a soda and a lighter.
A real cool cat that would let you keep a dollar,
But now things change, and it's the days of tomorrow.
Little kids is big now,
They'll push your wig now.
Can't send them to the store,
But you can send them for roll
And put them on my vine,
And give them one big push for all mankind.

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss] 
People still taking rapping for a joke,
A passing hope,
Or a phrase with a rope.
What ever happened to the caddies, white walls, and spokes? 
Crates of records, turn tables, plenty of folks,
Remember playing in the streets, touch football.
Look, y'all,
Somebody get mad and bounce with they football.
Twenty four hour block parties,
Everybody on the block pissing, you a dark hardy.
Adults used to think I was scheming,
But I was dreaming to one day make a hot album and have 'em all fiendin'.
Now, every time, that I rhyme I can tell that you like it,
Be nursing the tunes like the mind of a psychic.
Your mind is weary, floating like a dove,
Sweating and things, like you were making love.
Control the crowd so they can accept it.
Total concentration is the perfect method.

[Bridge:]
Where's the love? 
Somebody tell me,
Where's the love? 
Because we want to know.

(Puff) 
I remember everybody I loved, everybody.
It wasn't always player hating,
There wasn't jealousy and all this envy,
It was the love.

[Sheek]
Hey yo, hip hop 
Set out in the park.
What? 
We used to do it out in the dark
All night long till the cops made us go,
Or till somebody's moms pulled the extension cord from the window.
Lees on, thinking you fresh,
Trying to impress
Shorty, with the baby hair pushed down on her forehead.
Ponytail swaying, she hot,
Standing like she bowl-legged, but she not.
You remember the days? 
That's when crack was affecting blacks like that.
Just drink some Valentine Ale, little reefer,
Friday night go check out Star Child at the theater.
That's all corrupt.
Over rap you might get bust.
Say the wrong thing:
End up in a permanent sling.
Went from shell tops to hollow tops.
Used to rock the bus stop.
Now we electric slide from the cops.
Want some veterans in this,
That ain't keeping it real.
Now, with God, we chill over a record deal.
Always the good ones to go,
Never your enemies die.
Till this day, I wonder why they took my man B.I.
No time to yell rhymes in the microphone.
Take this more serious than just a poem.
Rock party to party
While you're out the door.
But tear it up, yo, let's start love over.

The LOX,"Yeah, the game of life
In this game it's not whether you win or lose
But how you played the game
Come on

Everything involves The Lox
Ask the niggas with the money in the safe
And the cats on cell blocks
Car parked in the lot
Door is locked
And the only time the phone is blocked is when home is hot
I announce the bounce
Smooth like an ounce
Blow more ways than one
Y'all niggas count
One Mississippi - you can't get with me
Two Mississippi - you never gon' hit me
Three Mississippi - can't no bitch trick me
Four Mississippi - won't no dog sick me
Five Mississippi - we in Mississippi
Twenty deep in the block
Real niggas rock with me
Blazing, reving in the black 9-11
Lox out of sight like Michael Knight and Kevin
Living dead
Hoes giving head to the Feds
Catch him with the calico
Light him up in bed

It's a two-way street be large or small
Livin' the life, either you die or ball

For years
While you get all yours from Sears
What!? Nigga even my guns be Ger-man
Links, Cu-ban
Rugs, Persian
Now we can take this another level Pa-Pa
And simply bust your pinata you hot-sa
Lox take blocks
Turn 'em into Fort Knox
Cake wasn't blowin' here
Till we started going there
What!? I ain't hateing you cause you's a little richer
But you old and I'm young, so that mean I think quicker
When bitch drunk
I'm bent up
I bounce with the land blow
(?) Pump the missile
Black berry molassi
Flossin' with the bad mama sita
My chi-ca
Be ten cent
Job with the government
Tap the Fed line
So when they raid I'll be lovin' it

Cause we stop drama like anti-lock brakes
High stakes
Politic, pies and cakes
Real niggas do dirt, tell lies, then skate
What up son?
What you bullshittin' bout now huh?
Where we from?
Don't matter cause we gettin' it done
Land Rover, double sun roof
Bulletproof
Tangaray and grapefruit
Got me hurlin' on my boots
Man please
Spit it out, twist the trees
5-40 I fly when I'm dissin' the d's

Sip Dom  P. with ease
First two words I ever learn, cock and squeeze
Ain't about that
Trying to do without that
Makin' niggas fuck up their budget
Time to get their paper route back
L-O-X three letter word, black mall
With every last member of the team on the job
Whether ir be controllin' the street
Holdin' the heat
Really don't matter to me
Long as we eat

Another small town cat with a million dollar fetish 
Learned my first lesson in jail from a peasant 
Always seem pleasant 
Happy to be present 
Said he past due, shouldn't have been in the essence 
Streets is like your girl, treat it like your wife 
You can flirt around with drugs, but don't hit the pipe 
You can mess around with guns but death ain't right 
Hold your breath, next step, cause life ain't right 
If you with the wrong cats then your cyph ain't tight 
Styles hit the darkside, show them the light 
Life ended to the ice that freezes m.c.'s 
Friend of the flame, burn 'em in one game 
Tell oxygen he ain't hopping in 
He a little time nigga, I ain't thinking of stopping him 
Catch up first, you stretch up worse than them 
Been experts and done less work than them 
With no album, we net worth more than them 
These cats didn't think that the Lox could do it 
Got a hundred different styles that will guide you through it 
I'm the ghost of this shit, I provide you fluid 
Never crack sidewalks or ride the sewers 
You got some fly shit, but my shit 
Is like the whole city fallin out the sky bitch 
Loud tracks 
I'm the quiet loud ass 
Quick to set it off on your fucking foul ass 
Make six digits eight and cop a palace 
Make every rapper sick and call me malace 
Y'all niggas never know what the Stylez have 
Some shit in the stash that would crack a cow's back 
In a hundred pieces in they ass, and how's that? 
Never answer back, I'm the cancer on the track 
Just think, I could blink, and make the Pink Panther black

Who's not to be fucked with? 
That's me 
Who's to be fucked with? 
That's them 
Why don't you watch my back while I go ask them? 
And if they want beef later on I splash them 
And if they want to flow, right now I thrash them 
Should I give it to them new style or old fashion

Do I have to break down the walls 
Stay off the floor 
I'm the general dog, I start the war 
Make every m.c. never spit again 
When I leave 'em empty 
No guts, no chest, no brain, no game 
Stylez go broke, I'm a rob the folk train 
I feel no pain 
Steal cocaine 
Fuck black thugs that run through whole gangs 
Anytime that I want it nigga, better listen 
Blunt is the magic wand, I'm the magician 
Stylez is the virus, ain't no physician 
With an anecdote that can stop my collision 
Before you start asking, I'm a start splashing 
When I come through, it's like ten planes crashing 
Twenty ships, full of thugs, all of them is bastards 
Mashed up, looking through binocs, about to crash in 
What's the next issue? 
Sheek did official 
Called Spielberg, cops get tissue 
So you can rock in the sky when feds come and get you 
Next question is where nasa at? 
We need a hundred G's, can fly, when traffic bad 
When we down on the craps 
We plasmic gats 
Telling you now you can't fuck with dinero 
Got a lot of space when it seem real narrow

Hundred at a time, killing a hundred heroes

Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck 
If I ain't gettin' proper respect

If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin' to die 
I ain't tryin' to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky 
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie 
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time

Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin' to bubble

Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair 
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear 
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew 
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin' to you 
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye? 
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die 
From rappin' or tellin' some cat to reach for the sky 
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga 
Bounty hunt your whole crew 'til my bullets go through, what? 

All I need is a big gun and a coupe that's crazy quick 
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six 
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks

And the ambulance'll take longer if they think you shot

In front of the store rockin gauze in the woolrich
Blowin sticky green grass, that'll sit me on my ass
Wit a mean sports coupe with 160 on the dash

I pull my gun out, and bet I get another one tonight
Your brother died, bet your mother lose another son tonight
I'm clever, only time we party, when we beat a body
Or when they free Gotti, so that means never
To my niggas in they cell wit a hour of rec
Or K.L., for beatin a coward to death
I feel why'all, so feel me, even if why'all guilty
Time why'all niggas come home, the god'll be filthy

That way the press and the cops run shit, feel me kid

I even pick up your shells so you won't get caught
Dumb dumbs, niggas camouflaged playin as bums
Pop up, shoot through the liquor bottle, straighten your lungs
Take the bum clothes off, buy a paper at the newsstand

This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit 
Hitting wit the hardest shit, 'cause 'fore we started shit 
Wit kids I knew my friends all turned against me 
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this 
He got my back I got his, scheming on mad niggas 
That's how we do biz
It's about time to start another, robbing spree 
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump 
When I was up north, since 16 I was sending niggas home in a coffin 
Living like a orphan, you bad nigga? 
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here 
You know my style I'll put yo fucking man, in a wheelchair 
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me 
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me 
Cannot run, hit wit the hot one 
From the shotgun, cats was close, wondered how we got done 

E-V-E 
My dogs believe in me 
Petty thugs hide yo cake, never teasing me 
I show love to, all my bitches hustling one's, tussle wit thieves 
Making moves, second to none, I locked it, uh 
Made a sudden move you got bit 
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit 
The blonde hair bandit, you got guns, hand it 
Turn my face when I bust a cannon 
'Cause I don't wear sunblock

Click pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop 
Believe in this gang, we beat y'all, you got money? 
Keep y'alls, for us be tearing trying to i-dentify big dogs

And you can come see me if you trying to make a grand tonight 
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white 
I hate rap yo, I'd rather be planning a flight 
Somewhere hot on a Wave Runner, tanning wit dikes 
Blowing the haze, while all of 'em giving me brains 
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line 
And as for you playboy you can keep those raps
And keep your awards, my son can't eat those plaques 
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off 
Tints, rims, stashed, took the governor off 
Even the cats that be hating still be loving the dogs 
'Cause they know that the double R's coming for war 
What

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live? 
'Cause when I start swingin' the thing you hiding the kids 
And the P is still riding on trips, surviving the strip 
Beefing on the 4th you got to fly on the 5th 
Like I wasn't hustling hope or runnin' the block
Starving or not, carving the cheek, palming the Glock 
Figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch 
I like to knock off my work then I pull off a heist 
Put it together, double it twice, rider for life 
Catch me wit a 45, hot pair of Nikes 
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face 
Gimmie a shank, it's Holiday

You whether drown or die off torture, 'cause yo skins of ya 
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat 
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo chick a perm wit that 
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets 
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage 
Buck 40, buy the extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you 
You gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly

The LOX,"Intro: 
What  what 
You over there Styles? 
Yeah dog 
Second album nigga  real L.O.X. 
Blaze 
We run the streets  y'all know who to bet (C'mon) 
Fuck y'all niggas (Let's go) 

Verse One: 

Couldn't live the life I live 
Why's that 
I could die any minute  I get high every minute 
Fuckin' with snake niggas  and sleepin' with foul bitches 
Came through on the lightest whip with two pounds in it 
Pull over where the hustlers be 
Why's that 
Cause I get chills when you talk of hustlin' Gs 
So I'm always where the powder be at 
What it mean 
I can blow five bricks to ten in an hour if that 
Stay away from where the cowards be at 
Why's that 
Time is money god, and you can't get an hour back 
Or I would do it again to get the power back 
Have godfather status, make niggas bow to that 
You can all shine and glitter and keep the ones 
Fives and tens, for twenties and up, we dummy it up 
Make a lot of money, and look bummy and what 
Cause money ain't shit, respect is everything 
So if I kill niggas dead, don't ask me shit 
I take blunts to the head, so don't pass me shit 
I'd rather die from a bullet, than a nasty bitch 
If the good die young, all that mean to me 
is that the hood die young/ We call it the last days 
What you know about coppin a house to fight pits in 
Or blowin' weed smoke on the cops that write tickets 
Henny and what, shit we can semi it up 
With your picture on the wall, in memory of 
Stay in sync with the hood, gray minks with the hood 
We tryin' to get money like chinks in the hood 
They ask me how I'm doing now 
I tell 'em better than them 
And if your man front 
He can get eleven in him 
And if you told them once 
Then you better tell him again 
Ay yo, now let's see 
Who you know fuckin with Sheek Luc, Jadakiss, 
And S' paper 

Chorus: 

From dope money to rap money, and back to dope money (C'mon) 
Loaded guns, the empty ones, over dope money (Let's go) 
Car house in the smoke, over dope money (C'mon) 
All my niggas will die over dope money (Let's go) 
Bust your nine niggas, Side by side niggas (C'mon) 
We hit the ?wreek? of law, Run and hide niggas (Let's go) 
Death is the only thing that might divide niggas (C'mon) 
So don't fuck around with them Ryde or Die niggas (Let's go) 

Verse Two: 
So we speakin', all I know your face will be leakin' 
I rap full time and still pump bass on the weekend 
A nigga hoppin' all over the map 
And what you learn 
That niggas with long paper take longer to crap 
That's why every chance I me a gat 
And why you rather buy you a chain 
I aim at your brain 
Nigga, robbery is all we know, so how we gon go broke 
When we can just take all y'all dough 
And then fly out to Cuba, and get in the coke fields 
Die off the buddha, fifty and fifty mill 
Bring drama cause Gianconna got Kennedy killed 
If you come through in a jet, you frontin' wit us 
Cause when the coke price was up 
It was nuthin to us 
We got blocks full of heroin 
Weed and dust/ Seen bullets pop off 
Cause of greed and lust 
And when the big dogs die 
Who gon feed the pups 
My niggas is here, so you know the circle is tight 
I circle the block, and cut off the lights 
Pray to Christ 
Cause when the cops come in, we carry shotguns 
Dem niggas with the most ice, get the hot ones 
Stay on your job, nigga I'ma stay on mine 
And if I lose my voice nigga, I'ma flow online 
And by next year, we should have a thousand guns 
Nigga Ruff Ryde, Ryde or Die Volume One 

Chorus: 

From dope money to rap money, and back to dope money (C'mon) 
Loaded guns, the empty ones, over dope money (Let's go) 
Car house in the smoke, over dope money (C'mon) 
All my niggas will die over dope money (Let's go) 
Bust your nine niggas, Side by side niggas (C'mon) 
We hit the weak in law, Run and hide niggas (Let's go) 
Death is the only thing that might divide niggas (C'mon)

The LOX,"Yo if gon' sleep on somethin, might as well be a bed
And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head
Cause if you targettin the L.O.X.
You might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots aint got blocks, ya punta muchacha
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in court, yeah, keeps ya cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, aint no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag?  My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back

Ayo I hope you aint tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be fuckin her in the mouth
Type of nigga buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since niggaz was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me gats
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all shit, then listen to our shit
Ain't nuttin y'all faggots could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all niggaz ain't got shit
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggaz thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Harold

Suckin my dick, and I dont give a fuck what you spit
Who you are, where you from, and who the fuck you can get
Cause I sell records, plus I got a jail record
Y'all niggaz ain't sayin shit until y'all bare weapons

I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often
Comma, burnin niggas often
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin
Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry
Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me,  what type of shit you on? 
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon
Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
cause my fire retirin, aight then

Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

The LOX,"[Styles Paniro]
Yo, yo, I could keep my eyes closed still reading the signs
Young n****s think they hungry then you feed 'em a nine
Might kidnap they a**, start feedin' 'em swine
So I don't feel bad when I gut 'em like a pig
Beat him down, stomp him out, cut him like he big
You hear the attitude; I say f*** being humble
You act like a animal; you stuck in the jungle
N****s don't care if I'm poor or rich
So I don't care about these n****s, and the law, and s***
And I'll probably get shot for being a wild n****
You'll probably get shot for being a foul n****
Let's talk about slugs and the drugs we deal
Boys fight, men kill, get they money and chill
Real recognize real; I ain't sayin' a word
Doin eighty in the M - that means I'm stayin' in third
With a b**** playin' shottie AK in the third

[Sheek Louch]
Don't worry 'bout what I make; worry 'bout can you escape
'Cause when I bust my guns, bring more action than roll take
Nickel your hallway, I got aim from far
Y'all can't see me like the tints on the president's car
I know n****s don't like me, and my friends want to flip
That's why I'm on some extra all about Sheek s***
Your money: Sheek s***
Your b****: Sheek s***
Only thing I'm gonna share is these bullets here
B**** a** that's for frontin' 
Now don't say I never gave you nothin'
I'm greedy; go 'head, don't say I never saved you somethin'
Pack gun n**** but don't want no stack
I drink straight liquor till I forget where I'm at
I don't play no games, n****, drugs my 'cupation
In a building hustlin' - that's Sheek's Playstation
Motherf***ers want to ride by and ice grill
Change that to ice, dick
Show me, motherf***er, that you can kill

[Chours]
Seventeen shots in a clip, twenty-eight grams in an ounce
Everybody bounce, twenty-six inch hues on a truck
Thirty-six O's in a key, everybody free
Murder One felons with the glocks, twenty-four hours on the block
Bodies gettin' dropped, five thousand n****s actin' live
Five thousand n****s gotta die; everybody better ride

[Jadakiss]
Y'all n****s better find out who's your man
It don't work in the hood; you could fool your fans
Few bullets in your jeans soon to ruin your plans
Then I show up at the wake and boo-hoo at your fam
If you're like me, you never'll fail
Live by the three rules you make it, or be dead, or in jail
And I ain't really got much, but I'm up on cats
And Kiss don't just spit, I throw up on tracks
Double R now, b****; you see the princess cut
I'm in a two thousand big boy; the tense is up
Y'all n****s is soft; catch me with the semi
Underneath the Fendi, sweater, skully, and scarf
Make sure you don't say nothing to Jay
And keep your dirt; I don't smoke nothin' but hays
I'm a do this the old way; get it while I can get it
As much as I can get, then I'm a go my own way

[Drag-On]
Aiyyo, I keep my guns like laundry
I dump a load, make n****s fold, watch 'em die, and let 'em drip dry
Gon' spill pints from n****s; my rapid fire put n****s in black attire
Stuffed in the hearse, then dumped in the dirt
I live eternal, 'cause if Drag pa** away
I'm a come back with wraps on my face, blastin' an eighth
February eighth - that's the day
You better cop like it's crack, or get masking taped till you suffocate
B****es, y'all gettin' your feelings hurt
Two thousand, I ain't f***in' no more
I'm makin' b****es jerk till I squirt
All my b****es work, like upside down from the poles
Lift that skirt, give this dick what it's worth
Double R, see the icicles on the chest
Hungry n****s come snatchin'
I throw bullets; run catch 'em

Ruff Ryder Nigga, Volume 2
We show niggas the meaning of ryde or die
So all that bullshit you talking, go head nigga

(Jadakiss)
You don't gotta slap me five or give me a hug 
And it hurts when you gotta kill a nigga you love
But I'm gone deal wit my enemies sooner
Cause I got'em looking for my solo album like Kennedy Jr.
Fuck crush ice, go head and get your shine on
I'm bout to cop rocks that why'all niggas can climb on
Don't worry bout why I ain't got mine on
I want some new shit, I don't want nothing that you can tell time on
Things ain't all good right now 
Cause some more niggas die an turn all you in the hood right now
why'all can stop acting like that nigga J gone squeeze
Cause all I got is misdeameanors and some ACD's
why'all gon make me lay something down I promise
And Puff wear scarmas and listen to Carl Thomas
Fuck runnin and hidin, we copping more guns
An we coming outside cause somebody gotta die

(Chorus)
Go head you know we getting plenty of Dough
Go head you know we lighting plenty of dro
Go head you know we coming from why-O
Go head truly though Go head really though
Go Head you know we hitting plenty of hos
Go head you know we ripping plenty of shows
Go head you know we coming from why-O
Go head truly though Go head really though

(Sheek)
Now I warned why'all niggas that Sheek was the one
Now I'm warning why'all niggas that I got my gun
Read' to kill, don't worry bout no doctor bill
It ain't gone be one of those, just yo' casket closed
LOX, nah you rather fuck wit the cops
cause I'll pop and turn why'all like the optimum box
Mo pay-per-view, this trey-eight will do
some'in ugly and let the morgue zip up your crew
want to hope on our dicks and go Willie yo bikes
and wear Ruff Ryder tees, motherfucker please
You a Pocanos nigga, why don't you stick to the skis
And I don't hear a nigga raps no more
So I don't bother to go in the store an cop why'all shit
Only time I cop why'all shit if Lox on it
I shoot you in yo mouth ain't no calling the cops
I want my shit back like Castro and Elian's pop

Chorus 
(Styles)
I'm always that, I'm always this
But the floor stay nasty like hallway piss
If you here the P spitting it's a deep ass song
When I die mama bury me wit street clothes on
Cause drama be the threapy, the beef goes on
should've been speaking out of it makes it a lot
But I was fucking wit the savages, kicking the drop
Live for the money, die for my niggas, run from the law
Catch me smoking my weed or fucking your whore
Push my whip to the limit kind of hoping it flip
Throw my clip to the tip kind of hoping you flip
I feel sorry for the crackheads, but happy for myself
So I got mixed feelings about this hussling shit
I keep saying I'm gone quit after a couple of bricks
But I can't stop building and I don't pop children
But I got no problem kidnapping a bitch

Chorus 2x",Go Head,2000
The LOX,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

I come to your town on a Peter Pan, no Jack 
One pair of clothes, two hos and buggy with that 
Want to beef me?
Y'all niggas is borrowin' heat 
Callin' all across town to borrow a full pound 
Meanwhile this nigga got his guns to your noggin'
While your man with the heat is with some bitch up in the project 
He clappin' at you, you duckin', makin' you dance 
You should have spent it on some guns 
Instead of Iceberg pants 
What, L.O.X. off top
Pullin' our triggers 
With our guns on our lap
We ride around like Cali niggas  (West side!) 
Target motherfuckers
Cold hearted motherfuckers 
'Stead of young dumb your moms, and whoever she got with her 
There's a new-born in the house
Then I'm killin' the babysitter 
Y'all niggas all clowns in Sheek eyes 
Your moms would wear glasses
With the nose disguise around me 
Talkin' greasy 
Y'all like watermelons 
Big but crack easy 

[Chorus: x2]

[Jadakiss] 
Now if you know Jay
I never been a brother to front 
I be in L.A. wearin' any colors I want 
Rock guns like shirts
Block under the punk 
And I put somethin' hot
Anyone of you chumps 
And I know a few of you want to get my watch 
But it be a funeral if you get my watch 
It ain't nothing y'all can do to stop the Lox' wealth 
Run up in a gun store; cop the top shelf 
The crack-game is dead
All they want is weed now 
Chicks that I went to school with, a seed now 
You know Kiss, stocky, bald head, light brown 
Ice down, in my Roll look like night-town 
To all y'all, lil' Jada's for the thousandth time 
I recall hittin' your moms or writin' your rhymes 
And just because you might have seen me
In and out of your house 
Is no way that she gon' have a baby out of her mouth 

[Chorus]",Breathe Easy,2000
The LOX,"Oh
Hey, yo, Swiss
What's up?
I told you, baby, this, the one right here
This is the one
Sheek Louch
Oh my god
Yo, yo, yo, ay, yo

[Chorus: x2]
Hey, yo, y'all niggas want war?
Bring it on, c'mon
Y'all want war with Sheek?
Bring it on, c'mon
Y'all tryin' to stop how I eat?
Bring it on, c'mon
Bring it on, c'mon
Bring it on, c'mon

Yo, how you gon' talk shit when you soft as pudding
Knowing the work that these real thugs put in
We too legit
Let me hear you rap something 'bout us
I'm a break the hands of the man who wrote your shit
We take minks off backs
Them grimy niggas in clubs that make niggas walk
With them bodyguard cats
I'm glad I'm free
I feel like Harriet Tubman came and got me
From the white man property
It's all glitz and glitter, but no cash you getting
You hear the difference in that shit that I'm spittin'
Double R
That's street shit, and that's the way it has to be
Myself, Sheek Louch, and I'm still MTV
I can talk about guns
Go out, smack some nuns
Then flip and do a song with country music and shit
Don't ever play LOX for no fucking retard
'Cause your dough ain't that long that you can't see God
Plus these rap niggas out here respect the god
They know we spit that shit, so they respect our sound
They know how hard a motherfucker is and water that's down
Here, that's that shit right there
I swear from Yonkers, motherfucker
We'll bust in the air
Ain't nobody killin' clouds over here
Respect us
You bleed how we bleed
We bust how you bust
Yo, Swiss, help me out 
Sing this chorus for us
C'mon

[Chorus: x2]

Hey, yo, this here is for them cats that wild nonstop
Can't dance, just play the club and bop
No respect for the law
Fuck security, son
'Cause you big; that ain't stopping me from bustin' my gun
It's a fact that fire burns and shit stink
It's also a fact that your vest only protectin' your chest
You ain't think about your head when you was talkin' that mess
Or this knife
Across your face; scar you for life
Now do you really want to rock that ice?
Heh heh
Do your security really love your life
Or do they just want their check?
You think they gon' take one in the neck
For a nigga with no respect
For his crew
Man, we don't wear half on Chinese food
Slept in the same bed
Same chick gave us head
Brothers, and we ain't gon' stop till we all dead
Ain't shit gon' change
Just the dough gon' change
Fuck a Bentley
I'm good with a rubber-band-colored Range
I empty a clip at you 
You send nothing in exchange
Y'all niggas mad soft 
No heart, all brains
But what's smart when a dumb-dumb burst your heart?
I'm done now, but first hold up, hold your applause
I got one question to ask y'all: do y'all niggas want war?

[Chorus: x6]",Bring It On,2000
The LOX,"Shit 
Feel this 

If your hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you (fuck you) 
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you (fuck you) 
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you (fuck you) 
Only my man blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you 
 
Yo, everybody's a snake 
That's why I try to keep the grass cut 
So I can see 'em when they coming 
Then I heat they ass up 
'Cause' them niggas that you went to school with 
Will catch you while you in your new whip 
And turn your brains into Cool Whip 
Niggas that you running round getting ass with 
Ain't gon' help you do nothing but carry your casket 
Got the nerve to ask Kiss why I smoke so much 
And how I'm such a young nigga that seem to know so much 
While you was running round pumping for niggas 
I was listening 
And you still pumping for niggas 
I'm coming through visiting 
You heard, L-O-X came through in a yellow Lex 
And hop out with the Air Force One's with yellow checks 
And you liable to see me Dolo, icing the Rolo 
Burner under the Polo, a lot of y'all is homos 
Funny style niggas never down with me 
Type that go to the bathroom, sit down and pee 
I'll empty your house, back of your cribs, smacking your kids 
Bullets going through your leather, cracking your ribs 
Don't even hit me on my hip if I ain't give you a call 
And I ain't got a home phone number, I live on the road 
Now I'm getting bigger checks, conference calls with bigger 'xecs 
Bigger bracelets with bigger begets, 
Fuck y'all 

All I do is get high, and think of faving you all 
Motherfuckers hit 'cha knees and just pray to the Lord 
I'd rather die today than live tomorrow 
Then watch you crab motherfuckers just steal and ball 
Put in my work, you might get put in a church 
Funeral time, everybody kissing the corpse 
Learn the ropes, stone rip if you soft, you pissing me off 
Call me S.P., and I spit on your boss 
You can die cause this shit might happen to me 
But I'mma still happen to be, packin' the three
Fuck with bitches that be wrappin' the keys 
And the niggas that bug over drug money, clappin' the D 
Shoot in the breeze, nine in the boot, full of trees 
One in the morning, catch me with a gun on the corner 
Let you know it's all real and you can front if you want to 
I understand, fuck it dog, die in the can 
I say you pussy, you won't die for your right-hand man 
As well as your left, niggas trip, fell into death 
They touch you, only thing else to say is fuck you 
 
A-yo, y'all niggas ain't hardcore, all my niggas is homicide 
What you know about getting shot, letting the drip dry 
Letting the spit fly, seeing sparks whiz by 
Putting a MASH on niggas like Klinger and Horgi 
So soft you smushy, I blast 'til your shit is gushy 
Should be the head Cat in the Broadway play, you pussy 
Fuck with Sheek, Ouija board spell ""Death"" 
You can talk that beef shit, I hope that deep shit 
Be as deep as you inside the fucking cement 
Or you can deep sea dive, with no scuba gear 
I'll drown you with your snorkel on, bitch, breathe out of there 
Whole team rich, never seen a summer like this 
Baking hot, and you can sled ride down my wrist, neck, and hand 
When it comes to coke, I can make a snowman, shit 
Play in this shit make a angel with it 
And I don't give a fuck about that 380 that y'all share 
Between the 10 y'all with the same 8 bullets from last year 
When I bust I use snubs, denim flee in the spot 
The hand I write with need a oven glove, my shit so hot 
I want the most, Roley only work when it's next to my post 
Fuck a present gimme a yacht master, regular bezzy 
Then I'm good when I'm in the hood and I'm on the block 
You got a gut feeling about shit, nigga, that means you shot, what 

If you hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you 
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you 
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you 
Only my man's blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you 
 
I'll tell you in your face, fuck you 
Pull it off my waist, hit you up, fuck you 
And watch you die on the street, fuck you 
Whoever feel sad at the funeral, fuck them too",F*** You,2000

Styles P Shit
If P want you dead, I ain't comin' wit niggas 
Just a blunt and a tre pound, plenty of liquor 
So ya homies got something to pour 
That's that old school shit 
I ain't tryin' to put you under the floor 
I'm tryin' ta bang niggas over the clouds 
And I heard you say you rich 
So you can't get lower than Styles 
Kill everybody dead just so no one can smile 
Play the streets my whole life and I been flowin' a while 
Biget I rock, ever since my nigga was shot and my other nigga 
Was shoot shit I'm tellin' the truth 
If I lie, may I die in the middle of the verse 
My niggas hustle from first to first 
Twelve months in a year 
Gun on your waist, Blunt in your ear 
Pat in your sock, Trade at the back of the block 
With a fein watchin' for knorx till the shit get dark 
We jump in the hoop ride, instead of the six 
While you lookin' for a bitch, we lookin' for a brick 
That we can cook by six and give the whole block a fix 
Catch me on ""?"" gettin' sixty a shift 
Holiday Styles, nigga I ain't nothin' but streets 
Just as hard as the shit, that be under your feet 
And the only time I front is with a blunt and a beat

You know 
Murderin' niggas 
You want doe, they servin' you niggas 
Stay on fifth, Gettin' swervin' on niggas 
You know 
Whether we ride or we die we gonna get this doe 

All I know is drugs and guns 
And plenty of weed 
And that bitch that suck dick 
And niggas that bleed 
And if you're rich before you go 
Get a watch and a drop 
You better hit the court house 
And better bail out the block 
If your son ain't worth shit 
Niggas'll smuggle your daughter 
I come through in a Porshe 
The same color as water 
I got weight, what you want 
I can cover the order 
They call me Boss when I cross the border 
Six shot ""caught her?"" 
I hear niggas say my face is screwed 
But I'll put six in your stomach nigga 
Lace your food 
Scream ""Fuck Every Rapper"" that hate that I'm rude 
But that's that SP shit, you can take it or move 
We can let the bullets spill, till we all get killed 
There's only six nice rappers 
If you want to be real 
Niggas die everyday from talking that dumb shit 
That where they're from shit 
All that mean to me is you can get your gun quick 
Just another dumb bitch 
Go to church to get the holy ghost 
I did my dirt and got the holy ghost 
Look at the world through a niggas eyes 
Don't be a bitch, you gonna live and die 
Rivin' in the sky, but no love when you slither by 
I pray to god that we make it to heaven 
But the only thing we makin' is channel eleven 
You know four, five and seven, hot as fuck 
And every rapper be dead, if they were hotter than us 
But since niggas still alive they should be telling you somethin' 
You ain't hear from Holiday, he ain't tellin' you nothin' 
You know, cocksucker

'cause when the bullets go off they be under the tree 
I'm at your chick's house bagging up 
Groupies styled out 
The cool-Aid too sweet and the phone don't dial out 
You don't gotta like me 
I show up to your wedding 
Rocking a white tee 
Your wife like oh-wee 
And if I dance wit her 
Then I got a chance wit her 
But I ain't gonna do her 
I'ma wait till after the honeymoon to screw her 
And let niggas run through her 
For y'all that's behind that wall blocking the street 
Homemade do-rags off the top of the briefs 
Everybody get they turn to live 
You just gotta know when it's your turn don't burn your bridge 
And all the real niggas will die the worms'll live 
And that's real fucked up but that's how shit is 
Scream it

Now you can quote me on this
I bust my gun
Also quote me on this
I handle my biz
I knew it was my house when Run was sayin it was his
I ain't lying
Ain't no cords or no steam in this iron
But it is a permanent press
Have these 38 shells spray starch your chest
Leave you stiff
Coroners make ashes of you
In rap I'm like God nigga forever above you
If I don't do it all I just dial my phone
And you get sprayed through your clothes like you put on cologne
If it's not violence or drugs I have nothing to spit
I be lying if I talk some spiritual shit
Like Kirk Franklin and them
Y'all just ain't me
I can't tell you about God but I can tell you about a key
And what I'll do to God's children if they jerk me
Hurt me , never , that'll be a sin
I'ma put the Bible to your head and shoot through Matthew verse 10
What
C'mon niggas
What

[Chorus: x2]
You told me you would bust your guns for me
(Yeah bust your gun dog)
You said you'd always sling your pounds
(Sling the hydro green)
Now you're away and you're all that I need
(You're all that I need baby)
But L-O-X will hold it down
(You know the LOX gonna hold it)

[Jadakiss]
I'm back in the game
I still ride the back of the train
And sit right next to Jake with a package of Caine
Niggas say he realer than me you call him a liar
I got the Audi T T the same color as fire
You just getting a name
Putting shit in the game
Stop faking
I have your do-rag looking Jamaican
Holey as the water in the front of the church
Then find you with no back plus one in your earth
I can't wait for the day you get murked
Cause I'ma throw a free party at the Tunnel and give out work
I love myself , my family , and love my son
Love my niggas and love white Air Force Ones
And besides that I'm open off the dro and the guns
And the head you could get from a hoe in the slums
Niggas always act silly till you show em the milly
Then they got the nerve to ask you why you wanna kill me
Uhh

[Chorus: x2]

[Styles]
I know it ain't right
For me to swear to God
But I swear to God that I'll murder you dog
And I know it ain't right
For me to sell dope
Rob stores but I still gotta run from the law
Twenty niggas in the clique
How all of us pour
In a three room apartment and we all on the floor
I reflect to the days I thought of busting the whip
Now I come through the scene and niggas cuffing they bitch
Feel good to see Kiss spend a buck on his wrists
Or Sheek fronting on a jet ski with a Puerto Rican chick
I don't rock no jewels
But I pops my tools
And I work my coupe to do a buck 68
P hit you in the head like a dutch to the face
Or a cup full of liquor
Come and fuck with you nigga
Cause I make drug money
Gotta take blood from me
If you wanna prove a point pull a joint shoot dummies

Hey yo
Yo I'ma B-boy standing in my B-boy stance 
Glock on my hip is big is the dick in my pants 
You don't want nothing wit sheek you soft as fuck 
I leave a single shotgun shell on top of your truck 
Wit a horseshoe to let you know you pressin' ya luck 
You don't want nothing wit kiss, nothing wit styles 
You don't want to end up food for the crocodiles 
I'd take the gun off ya waste and smack ya  
And turn around and point it at ya mink and give you one 
I'm the reason why ya peeps not in ICU 
Cause believe me when you ain't watching I see you 
From the Hamptons to the place where you like to eat 
I put something in them mams you keep thinking is sweet 
I'm in the bushes all night calm wit' the Tommy 
Waiting for you to skinny dip wit' that mommy 
While she waiting for the night I'm waiting for her flight

Yo if you should die tonight 
It's cause I said peel his cap 
We on Ruffryders now 
How real is that 
It's the kiss of death everybody know J- face 
Us gettin off similar to OJ's case 
Just better rhymes and better beats involved 
Less politics more of the streets involved 
Things always go smooth when the heats involved 
Sign today or get beat tomorrow 
First one talking that family shit 
And get a lot of doe and don't give the family shit 
I don't care how many ? you wrote 
I just want to see how you gonna dance when your neck get broke 
If y'all do fall down I'ma scoop the ? 
No shiny suits 
Everybody boots and jeans 
The industry is one thing being real is another 
That means I'll steal your mother 

[Chorus: x2]
 
[Styles]
Yo if you left the peak balling I don't feel yo ass 
I wish duke was still alive and they killed yo ass 
You can keep an industry but don't you come to the hood 
I got a thousand niggas like me and they feel like suge 
If you think I'm beefing for nothing then rob me dog 
I'm from the hood 
And I ain't bee robbed before 
Tell you screw all the paper work 
You can lie in dirt 
Walk through the valley nigga tell me if the iron hurt 
Ruff rider now cause that's where the bombs at 
And I tell niggas fuck that car jack 
Take the roley out the air put the don back 
Can't wear shiney suits on combat 
Guess I got personal beef 
You worse then a thief 
Probably be your man that'll work you to sleep 
We goin put the guns down and we ain't bringing a crew 
You got friends that hate yo ass more than we do nigga

With sweats and scuffed kicks 
I supply all the dealers and tell em to stuff nix 
I done signed every autograph and took every flick 
I'm quite sure that I coulda hit 
Every chick 
But I didn't ones that I did gave em heavy dick

And their ain't enough plates for y'all to eat with me

From your street rappin's only one of my plans

Told you I get deep with a gun
If I die then my niggas teach the rules of the street to myson
Cause I might got to meet with the lord
What I live by? die by?
My gun, my word, and my sword
Cause niggas sound hard but they just ain't convincing me
Microwave killer, do my shit instantly
Built that courage in Anna, it's the dark side
that makes me want to flip and go smother your mama (bitch)
Just for birthing your ass
And this the ghost when you take your last breath
And I'm cursing your ass
And I'm sort of like the Grim Reaper, but I'm a get deeper

Even in the boot Luch keep a gat in his hand
Brick under the fan, think I care about a moon man or Grammyaward?
What did you expect? I ain't seeing double platinum
unless I take it off your fucking neck (right now)
Cut my check and get out my face
Before I go home and get that new shit out the case (no doubt)
I don't think y'all hearing me, it's not fair to me
I'll clap you if my niggas is daring me

Booted out something decent
Up to light a blunt, wild out, and shoot it out with the precinct

When the pigs come through they medullas is off

Picked her up in the Porsche, skipped off to a yacht
Came back and had dinner at the ?

And all of her friends hate when I come around
Cause they know money's involved, the Coupe or the

23 and 20s involved
Might rain all day and be sunny tomorrow

Always do the right thing, or at least try to
But the way I put it on you is exclusive, ma
So all that talk that your friends do is useless, ma

Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?
And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
When I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of five's, a six, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name?  And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.

I told you the pain was comin
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference?  Either way I'm stunnin your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose
Somethin to prove?  Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull

I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella

I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer?  Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa, watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture?  Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga

If your hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you (fuck you) 
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you (fuck you) 
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you (fuck you) 
Only my man blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you 
 
Yo, everybody's a snake 
That's why I try to keep the grass cut 
So I can see 'em when they coming 
Then I heat they ass up 
'Cause' them niggas that you went to school with 
Will catch you while you in your new whip 
And turn your brains into Cool Whip 
Niggas that you running round getting ass with 
Ain't gon' help you do nothing but carry your casket 
Got the nerve to ask Kiss why I smoke so much 
And how I'm such a young nigga that seem to know so much 
While you was running round pumping for niggas 
I was listening 
And you still pumping for niggas 
I'm coming through visiting 
You heard, L-O-X came through in a yellow Lex 
And hop out with the Air Force One's with yellow checks 
And you liable to see me Dolo, icing the Rolo 
Burner under the Polo, a lot of y'all is homos 
Funny style niggas never down with me 
Type that go to the bathroom, sit down and pee 
I'll empty your house, back of your cribs, smacking your kids 
Bullets going through your leather, cracking your ribs 
Don't even hit me on my hip if I ain't give you a call 
And I ain't got a home phone number, I live on the road 
Now I'm getting bigger checks, conference calls with bigger 'xecs 
Bigger bracelets with bigger begets, 
Fuck y'all 

All I do is get high, and think of faving you all 
Motherfuckers hit 'cha knees and just pray to the Lord 
I'd rather die today than live tomorrow 
Then watch you crab motherfuckers just steal and ball 
Put in my work, you might get put in a church 
Funeral time, everybody kissing the corpse 
Learn the ropes, stone rip if you soft, you pissing me off 
Call me S.P., and I spit on your boss 
You can die cause this shit might happen to me 
But I'mma still happen to be, packin' the three
Fuck with bitches that be wrappin' the keys 
And the niggas that bug over drug money, clappin' the D 
Shoot in the breeze, nine in the boot, full of trees 
One in the morning, catch me with a gun on the corner 
Let you know it's all real and you can front if you want to 
I understand, fuck it dog, die in the can 
I say you pussy, you won't die for your right-hand man 
As well as your left, niggas trip, fell into death 
They touch you, only thing else to say is fuck you 
 
A-yo, y'all niggas ain't hardcore, all my niggas is homicide 
What you know about getting shot, letting the drip dry 
Letting the spit fly, seeing sparks whiz by 
Putting a MASH on niggas like Klinger and Horgi 
So soft you smushy, I blast 'til your shit is gushy 
Should be the head Cat in the Broadway play, you pussy 
Fuck with Sheek, Ouija board spell ""Death"" 
You can talk that beef shit, I hope that deep shit 
Be as deep as you inside the fucking cement 
Or you can deep sea dive, with no scuba gear 
I'll drown you with your snorkel on, bitch, breathe out of there 
Whole team rich, never seen a summer like this 
Baking hot, and you can sled ride down my wrist, neck, and hand 
When it comes to coke, I can make a snowman, shit 
Play in this shit make a angel with it 
And I don't give a fuck about that 380 that y'all share 
Between the 10 y'all with the same 8 bullets from last year 
When I bust I use snubs, denim flee in the spot 
The hand I write with need a oven glove, my shit so hot 
I want the most, Roley only work when it's next to my post 
Fuck a present gimme a yacht master, regular bezzy 
Then I'm good when I'm in the hood and I'm on the block 
You got a gut feeling about shit, nigga, that means you shot, what 

If you hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you 
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you 
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you 
Only my man's blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you

The bubbles rise while my heart sinks
And I'll I tend to do is think of you

Was it easier to pack your bags
And book that flight to Paris as
The plane began to move that afternoon

When all the trains have pulled away
From local stations in decay
It's I who waits, it's you who's late again

And did you think of me when you made love
To him, was it the same as us
Or was it different, it must have been

And all the pretty dames
They'll hug and kiss you all the same
And when they go, they're gone
They're not run-ning late
Oh all, all the pretty dames

And the kids you hold in your arms
With promises to protect them from harm
But they grow, and they go
And you're all alone
All the kids, all the kids that you hold

And it's a shame that it ends this way
With nothing left to say
So just sit on your hands, while I walk away
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame

When bitterness is all I taste
And my car won't stop
'Cause I cut the brakes

It is I, Jesus, Shock Jesus
And what brings you brothers to such an early fate?
	Man, no what the fuck man
	Niggaz just shot me man, what the fuck man
How dare you use such language in the face of the almighty
	Fuck you
You shall perish (beitch!!)
It is my judgement that you shall burn in hell

5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni

I wish I had cot (what?) I wish I had some cot (why?)
So I could sky and have a place to lay my head and plot
A broke nigga boney
Quick to lick but I could never steal shit from my homies
I play acts and make scratch from table scraps
and always end up fucked watchin other niggaz backs
I broke hamps wit my folks and get pounds
but in the mist of funk
would they really bust rounds?
I get woozie when I inhale all the badness
I swear to the Lord when I was young I never had this problem
I stressed the fuck out gotta doubt my own niggaz
I try to solve my problems wit hamps and liquor
I used to swig a 22, graduated to a 64
and now I don't smoke weed no mo'
And I ain't knowin where I'm headin
Most likely it's the scene of creamery
I'm petrified of the whole scenery
The game is some shit ya either roll wit
Or give up because the game is quick to make a nigga stroke it
For less is what I was wishin for it never came true
So it came to plannin missions damn near shittin in my drawers
I gotta play my part though and take what I can
from the niggaz I don't got Scarface nigga I feel ya
By any means nescescary
That's why they find scary niggaz buried
Carried to a whole 'nother place
If youse a hard nigga die with a smirk on your face
So much drama, I put my best in it 
Peace, I'd rather live than rather rest in it
Where I'm from or where I'm headed, it ain't no love
I give thanx that I'm alive to the man up above
I'm still takin shit day by day
Survin off a nifty, that's why I'm goin 5150

Ripley's won't believe I'm shot, limpin down the block
Tryin to scoot out, carry the bloody glock
Cause niggaz they plot, it was a shoot out
Tryin to take the loot out my pocket 
But I'm quick to let the glock spit at his 350 rocket
Then I split runnin down the block 
No sense of dick made them bitch made niggaz whip out a gauge
Then blaze my ribcage, I'm dazed
on the ground hella bleeedin ass out
I remember seein somebody put me in a glass house, I passed out
Then my spirit arose up out my flesh, I'm old
No more bullet holes in my chest
A gold vest when I awaken for Mista Go-Tec-9 is awaitin
The Lord has no love for playa hatin
I'm facin Shock Jesus cause I'm the G-ist nigga to do the job right
Because I'm trained up in that mob life
Come back tonite strapped tonite
He said if I succeed he'll bring my family and dead homies back to life
A big ass eagle scooped me up then we bails out
Flyin through the cuts goin the secret hill route
The whole scene was a disaster
Friday the 13th the final chapter 
Lookin niggaz wit casper the ghost
But I float until I smoked the big man
Slipped in quick sand
He's gonna kill me but my spirit slipped in my body
I yelled watch out he's gonna get me
They didn't get me, huh, they labelled my ass 5150

How can I get blame for shit
That a nigga really didn't even do
One nigga did the dirt, but the blames on the whole crew
I feel like O.J., and Rodney
A little mayo, but still don't be havin'
No happy days like Potsy
Nigga's get blamed for every thang
From robbin you house, to ho stroll's
And the Tropicana cocaine
And if the sun turned black
""Yup a nigga did it Jim"" or
""Get a nigger over so I blame it on him""
Nigga's getttin' like the oldies
Played the fuck out, we only known for stealin' cars and drinkin' 40's
Or showin your whole ass crack on cops
They quick to do a nigga on the routine stop
Chopped rock's, in a nigga possession, a whole zip
Blame me cause I'm one of fo' grips
Now you can have mayo and a gang of triggers
Bit that ain't shit, cause they still gon blame a nigga

Boy I tell ya Jim, one of those black niggers took
The battery outta my car last night
I did see it, but I know those were niggers

Drivin' down the block, and what did I see
A police man tryna gaffle me
Threw down my rocks, so I wouldn't get caught
A high-speed chase for forty-eight blocks

I heard some shit was goin' down though
It might be scandalous, on the down low
Plus I get around ho, like Shock and Mon'
Walkin' to the lot, forgot I got the gun
In the bushes, more mayo then the rest of the pushers
Tonight a nigga might be readin' my Nike's like Bushwick
Chronic smoke like chimney, to lit a doobie
They knew me, let me in free cause I bee that Luni
Higher then the police sky waves off the blue
I partied two or three hours now I'm sideways in the sukra
To the hoopsta's, survival is the be-under
But I was in it, now five-oh's on my bumper
Ready to dump the forty outie, and weed baggies
They had me searchin' through my car, for what we have we here
A queer tryna frame a nigga, but shame on a nigga
That try to put the blame on a nigga

""Always gotta blame a god damn nigga
900 blame a nigga""

Uh, hello, this is 900 blame a nigger?
Uh, my daughter's raped, and comin' back from
A Ku Klux Clan meetin', and I know a nigger did it

Last night was the night before
Twenty-four robber's came knocking at my door
I ran out, they ran in, tryna blast for my cash
Wit ski-masks on they're chin

Take a puff from my hamp then bounce
I'm on a mission for scrilla, vanilla slugs by my zipper
Playa haters trippin' off ho's it seems that they plot
Snitch to the cops, and swear that I chopped O's of cream
Who stole the cookie out the cookie jar!
That's what they mumble
Now knowin' about the power of numskull!
Now I done had it wit all that static
I'm thinkin' I should load my automatic
And let all these faggots have it

One love, it's cocked backed, and then I bust slugs
Roastin' a motherfucker, so busta always suffer
Blood in the ghetto, other niggas try to run up
Wit they gun, and get done from sun down to sun up, punk
Dead bodies in the trunk, they kept on tellin' me
Oh I was sellin' P.D. I was sellin D, I caught a felony
As soon as I got it, had to pop out a nigga brains
I was the wrong nigga to frame

Took me to Vegas, his fat ass fell asleep
I got him for his Rolex, and his car keys(whaat)
When I initialed back to the town
Sold his triple gold for a playa's price(HAHA!)

My balls spin off the wall mic goes, psycho's
Therapy to carry me, and felt me
A bitch can't help less that bitch wealthy
Cause they ain't shit but ho's and tricks
So I goes and gives the bitch the stolen grip
That left on my nigga's clothes and shit
Vogues and shit, for my hooptie, gucci link
Me don't want to no broke ass hoochie
Cause they coochie stink
Think, while your fa sho sho, bitch is a no no

She got your ass licked at the mo mo
Don't no why ya trustin the bitch
Cause she suckin ya dick

Sellin but on Novero, make dinero cash
Or get the eight and half up yo narrow ass

I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s 
Never the less, I'm hella fresh, 
Rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like ping pong,
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong,
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40,
And when it comes to get another stogie,
Fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with,
It's too many heads to be proper to let my friend hit it
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
5 dollar bill on the real before it's history
'Cause fools be having them vacuum lungs
An if you let em hit it for free you hella dum-da-dum-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land like where the bomb at
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back

Don't need no crutch

Till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bra
Hoochies can hit but they know they got to pitch in,
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no, you betta' bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that
Better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know ya got Asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, an guzzle it,
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed bro,
And every time we with Chris that fool rollin' up a fattie,
But the Tanqueray straight had me

Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm da roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, 'cause where I be's, we need half like a foo-foo

Til the joint be burnin my hand 
Next time I roll it in a Hampa 
To burn slo 
So the ashes won't be burnin up my hand, bra 
Hoes want to hit but they know they got to pitch in 
Then 
I roll a joint that's longer than your extension 
'cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free 
Fuck that 
You betta bring your own shit chief 
Wassup 
Don't babysit that 
You better pass the 
JOINT! nigga stop hittin 'cause you know ya got asthma 
Crack a 40 open homie 
An guzzel it 
'cause I know the weed in my system is gettin lonely 
I gotta take a piss test for my P.O. 
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked hella weed bro 
An everytime we with Chris 
That nigga rollin up a fattie 
But the Tanqueray straight had me 
Lit to the fullest extreme 
There was gettin no higher 
That shit had my chest on fire 
Dru Down was swiggin to the face straight 
But I ain't fuckin wit that 
I think I'll stick to the crazy 8's 
Bring me a bottle and I'm cool wit that 
I'm a lounge wit that 
Nigga bring me a phat sack 
I don't know how to roll 
But I know how to SMOKE! 
I think I'm gonna hit it til my ass choke.

Whooo-weee! Baby-boy! 
Dayyyymn!

Dayyyymn! 
Only Oakland got that Doja like that. 
Only the Town nigga. 
Eh man quit hoggin up the joint, man you baby sittin it. 
What you talking about? 
Pass that shit over here. 

[Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*] 
Playa 
Give me some brew an I might just chill 
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill 
I steal doobies 
Spit loogies when I puff on it 
I got some bucks on it 
But it ain't enuff on it 
Fuck wit the S the T, I-D-E-S 
Never the less 
I'm hella fresh 
Rollin joints like a cigarrette 
So pass it cross the table like ping pong 
I'm gone 
Beatin my chest like King Kong 
It's on, 
Wrap my lips around a 40 
And when it comes to get another stogie 
Niggas all kick in like Shinobi 
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with 
It's too many heads to be poppin to let my friend hit shit 
Unless you pull out the phat crispy 
Five dollar bill 
On the real before its history 
'cause niggas be havin' them vacuum lungs 
An if you let 'em hit it for free 
You hella dumb-do-dumb-dumb 
I come to school with the taylor on my earlobe 
Avoidin all the dick teasers 
Skeezers and weirdos 
That be fuckin off the land like Where tha bomb at? 
Give me two bucks 
You take a puff 
And pass my bomb back 
Suck up the dank like a slurpy 
The serious 
Bomb will make a nigga go delirous like Eddie Murphy 
I got more growin pains than Maggie 
'cause niggas snag me 
To take the dank out of the baggie

The Luniz,"Posted up in the cut
To make a buck I had to sell nuff drugs
Showed up, an rolled up, bubbled wit tough thugs that love to bust slugs
I had much love, from dope fiends
Plug 'em wit mo cream, my dangla
Used to sport Wranglers wit Pro Wings
Fa sho green-ery stacked up, that macked up
Quick to put the gat up an blast on niggaz that act up
Snatched the scratch up, quick hit the back fence loc
I been broke, rollin' through yo mutha fuckin' hood in trench coats
Wit double barrels get yo narrow ass on the ground
I'm not play, I don't play though
I'm out to get yo pay roll
Say hoe, you get yo monkey ass stomped wit the steel toe
Fucked in the game like a dildo
From the Vill hoe
To the mutha fuckin' Fil-Mo fo real though
None can get wit this sick wit it man slaughter
Practice lookin' harder than 40 Water
Niggaz all over claimin' they foldin' weight
I caught yo slippin', rippin' that duct tape over yo face an off the 
Golden Gate
Let go, I'm down to break jaws when I takes all's
Yo cash, blast that ass won't last fo' one mo day like Nate Dog
Break laws
Lethal weapon like Danny
Slangin' candy
Livin' lavish about my cabbage understands me.

[Chorus: x2]
Can't slang cream, can't lay low
Quick to pull licks for some paper to fold
It ain't me fuck gettin; fronted
(Gaffed and licks I done it, that's why a nigga always gets blunted)

I see what you see, but you don't see what I see
Mill an zips come up the whole grip like Kadafi
Twenty years of age, waitin' fo' the say someone say cap me
A whole line of felonies on my rap sheet
Any means to make loot in the East Oakland Bay route
It's all about makin' mail fuck bein' cute (woo)
That's the sound when it's time to lay down my hustle
Why there's so many bubbles, I choose to throw rocks like Barney Rubble
Can't lie back, wit a gang of top scratch
I gots to move on, an scoot on
Now mutha fucka can you buy that?
Lay low make no mistakes, make it successful
And if a nigga run up then make his chest full
I toss niggaz that try to struggle off me
Cross me
A gang of jealousy because I'm saucy
It's not my fault that I grew to become a licksta
Instead I say moms meetin' pops was a mix up
Pick up
Hennessy got my brain runnin' quicka than I can think
Adrenaline pumpin' about to faint
Ain't no shame
Can't be no nine to five nigga
The ""O"" is where I'm from, so I gots to survive nigga.

[Chorus: x2]

Nigga notice I'm broke wit a loaded four-fifth gat
The real nigga rolled an showed us where you hide yo doe an shit at
He did just that, showed me where the kicks at
An big scratch told Knum to come nigga lets get that.

Yuk pull over
Park the Nova
Tonight's the night, so I hope you write about the yola
I hold the Mag, lookin' for the attack
Search the whole fuckin' crib 'cause I know he got scratch.

Creep up the mutha fuckin' stairs wit the ski mask
On the second floor in the drawer there should be cash
But we laugh
'Cause we see task cars right next door
But we poor, no budget fuck it, so kick down the door.

Boom kick it once
Boom kick it twice
Three times it's breakin' an have the fuckin' building shakin'
Make our way through the house nothin' less nothin' more
(Where the kicks at?)
I think they in the third drawer.

There's more
An that's a fa sho-sho I got the doe, now we up out the door
Before the neighbors call po-po
To the mobile, to count the real deal bank roll
In my sock, I rub daily 'cause it's scratchin' my ankle.

It's morning
We unleash to the streets
Wit twelve G's a piece
Headed straight to the East
Better recognize this game is bought to be sold
That's why I pull licks fo' some paper to fold.

So crack ends, givin me jaw, I be call fuckin' around wit mo ups & downs

Sometimes I feel like I'm broke, sometimes I'm shot calla 
Who got all the bitches lost in the motions like Pala 
Balla than shisty, mo betta blues then Spike Lee 
Might be off the 40 'cause I'm OG like Ice-T 
Ya dig? 

Smoke hoes, an coke hoes, are sumpthin' like the same 
One fo the white dope, one fo the nigga that's in the game 
Now I know bitches that say ""Richard, do what ya want to"" 
But like old Vogues them bitches cry when I hit the corner 
My 7-duce, produce, 'cause the zues was pissed off 
I'm still gettin' zips off 
Niggaz feelin' ripped off, an clipped off 
Until they told me, it was Knumskull, Yuk an Dru 
Now what you want to do? 
It's thirty five-hundred for the straight laced triple gold, wit the vogues 
That's what they cost in the store, yeah 
An you can reach, but you can not touch 
Ever figga, scared nigga that you feared too much? 
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts 
To find out, she works for me 
Brought me that Jeep 
That's why I, keep my bitch business in the cut 
That way I gets yo skrilla, plus I get to fuck, 
'Cause we.

I'm steadily stackin' up on the green 
Ballas will use the triple beam 
Shot calla use they words 
Hustlas will use they shoulders, playas sit back an get served 
Now observe the definition of the pimp-mode 
I take hoes, an break hoes, an hoes is stayin mobile, really though 
Doe is what I love, so what's up? 
Nigga who you tellin, that life always been tough 
Nigga I had it rough 
An nigga it ain't no bluff 
An potna I had my own mama sufferin', that's sumpthin' 
Yeah okay 
I turned straight into a hustla 
Crap on bustas 
Skrilla fo reala from them suckas 
I gave my mama half, me half, I'm out the door 
Ready to bubble 
I turned into a balla, shot calla 
Two for twamp 
With in a year I'm back on the spot 
Zippas in zipper, I'm ready to hit some fences, it's so wicked 
Bitch you jack rabbit call me Bugsy 
Four-four up in the Paddy wagon, to break my niggaz love me 
An I'll be sure the next time niggaz see me I'll be high 
Do or die, throwin up the 5, in the 5th lane right

I swerve to the curb, about 3 an you know that I straight broke that

So playa hataz hate me, 
I keep the safety off my four-fifth, 
Hold it in focus,

But's who's that, an next, 
I heard them ridin' around smokin' crack in the back of my homies Lex, 
It be them broke ass, no cash, 
Bustaz tryin to quote that's why the Town got rid 'o $hort, 
I think you busta browns need to wise up, 
Before we ride up, 
Stop, 
Sew up yo block, an sew them lies up, 
Once don't trip, 
Twice no grip, 
Three timmesss, will get you bucked wit the nine, 
I thought the hatin' would stop, but the rumors are passin' still, 
Sounds like that busta that plugged mo holes than mass appeal, 
You need to stop!!

You stress, 
When you test the young Hugh Heff,

Chest get lit up, 
Foo that's a rigg up, 

Now I think the whole world knows me, 
Not what they should know, 
It's like rap an sellin' crack is all I'm good for, 
Hangin' in the hood for so long, 
I see why they talk, 
Bitches, 
Snitch a bustaz home.

You're wrong I won't be offended, 
I be there hand in hand wit the pencil, 
Can it all be so simple, 
Like Wu-Tang, spit true game, to get pootang, 
From a nimfo. 

Now I keep sayin, 
Don't get mad 'cause you can't bump me, 
But I'm still gonna spit it, 
'Cause you still don't get it, 
If it ain't noted, don't quote it, 
Hataz when it comes to common sense you ain't showed it, 
I don't understand!

Hey, what's all this?? Hey stop all this confusion. Hey!! Order in the 
court.... YOU'RE GUILTY!!

No I'm not guilty, you're guilty. Law makers. Politicians. Business men. 
The police. You don't see no black folks dropping packages out of 
airplanes. You don't see none of that. You're the reason why, I'm a

Verse 1 *(Knumskull)*

I, spent hella time on the block late,
an I feel safe, as long as I can shoot the glock straight,
so come,
get the greenery,
rush to the bank collect yo doe,
make sho you got yo bucks in yo hand, 'cause the man,
(be comin around the mountian when he come!)
that's a rigg up,
I rather swallow my yay, an shit slugs,
fuck task, it's a must I bubble,
so many rocks in my jaw I feel like Barney Rubble,
I got my, pager,
an my, bus pass,
grab my Avion water juss incase I had to dust task,
it was about four otha niggaz on the spot grindin,
one was on my team smokin hamps an poppin leads,
(knock on weed nigga, fuck that knock on weed, you got a twenty??)
gave up two ten's an a bump 'cause I had plenty,
not even knowin what I juss did,
put the money in my pocket an headed back to the crib,
got a tingle on my dick feelin bad,
looked up an seen task cars comin at me,
so I bounced through a buildin lost all my cash,
swallowed my rocks, ditched my pager, I'm haulin ass,
then found myself by Blyman's house,
thinkin about juice,
hit the turf, sky out,
through the roof,
but that plan was cancelled,
betta give up,
betta throw yo hands up,
here comes the man,
the gloves on the other hand,
got on my knees, 
crossed my legs,
then threw up my hands,
one of them yelled ""Bitch hit the deck!!"",
Kevin Reese grabbed the stick an almost broke my neck,
I'm handcuffed on the ground wit a foot in my back,
then they asked me ""Hey where the fuck our money at??!!"",
now I'm stressin 'cause the dogs right beside me,
they took me down so that the under could identify me,
You got the right one BAY-BEE!!
Shot me downtown, 
threw me in a cell that's drivin me crazy,
so they booked me, 
walked me through the court door,
stripped me down, 
an gave me some drawls the next nigga wore,
I'm in my pad makin phone calls,
so I can post bail,
go home, 
an then put on my own drawls,
got in touch wit my nigga Yuk,
what's up fool??!!,
I got a quarter ounce hidden in the cut,
snatch it up,
get it off, 
come an get me,
before I go back to court an they judge can get wit me,
'cause the D-A, 
was talkin nonsense at my arraignment,
an think she's still talkin the same shit,
they try an keep me, 
locked up fo a grip,
an my public defender ain't sayin shit!!,
the deal is zero to twenty-eight days,
that shit is filthy!!,
now they got a nigga pleadin gulity.

*(Chorus)*

I ain't did nuthin wrong,
Why should I plead guilty??,
They caught me wit no work,
But they claim that we was filthy,

I ain't did nuthin wrong,
Why should I plead guilty??,
They caught me wit no work,
But they claim we doin dirt.

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*

It's like sixteen fiends get they welfare checks,
no po-po a 4-0 an some bomb,
an I'll be there when it comes to collect,
no po-po a 4-0 an some bomb,
Rolled up,

don't give a fuck what ya do,
grama thought I was a goodie two-shoes,
but I was too true,
now fools holla out the window like Rapunzel,
give the caulk up, rock up, an chop up my bundle,

gimme the crack sack,

We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front

[Verse 1:]
Bitches be lovin' how I dick em
When I get them in the mood to fuck
They hold up all my nuts and lick em
They break me off cash flow
Any damn thing I ask for
So a nigga paid up the asshole
Some fools be thinking they gotta win her like Bruce Jinna
But Joe Tenner is letting every nigger run up in her
Most of the tricks I pick up 
Like to get fucked 
As a bitch is a bitch as a hoe is a quick nut
Like this slut named Kim I knew
She fucked me, fucked him
And she fucked all of them too
So we worked the train on her
And left enough stains on her neck
Looking like a gold chain on her
No free high, the hoochie couldn't find two
Even though she popped that coochie like the hole from 2 Live Crew
So if you bump into this bitch on the streets
And you like the pussy deep, nigga speak
Because she's just a freak

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Cause a bitch is a bitch as a hoe is a quick nut

[Verse 2:]
I'll be rolling through your cup
Motherfuck, you what's up
Its that little nigga Yuck
And I don't give a fuck
Rolling through your neighborhood
Motherfucker, yo it's me
The capital N-you-see, K, L to the E 
See this is for them hoes and the trick tramp sluts
All these stupid bitches on my motherfucking nuts
All up on my nuts cause a niggas getting richer
Didn't mean to hit ya, hope you get the picture
Back in 91' you was a little bit stuck up
Acting like you didn't have time for the fuck up
Trying to walk the halls wit that little switch
Trying to play that roll but you ain't nothing but a bitch
A bitch on my dick cause you hoes make me sick
Come and get a lick of the dicks do a trick
Caught you in the mix with a fix turning tricks
Fucking one nigga while you licking two dicks
She's a freak

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Cause a bitch is a bitch as a hoe is a quick nut

Verse 3:
My dick up, but hick up bitch
But don't stick up your nose
Cause you don't look shit like En Vogue
Hoes taxi around them gold ones
Acting like they don't fuck no one
Be the master like Sho Gun
At the hot tubs making a gang of waves
Hoe in the cunt doing stunts like Super Dave
Ballas call her the human giraffe
No joke cause that ass be deep throating niggas on the quick fast
With no whiplash
You see me footing it but couldn't it be cool
Won't buy you assy food when we cruise, you lose
She give niggas blues like 505 don't ask why
I guess that stank bitch is a fall guy
You got no bucks, you can't fuck
We'll that's how I put it
C&H got that hole on tape, straight footage
The same bitch that wouldn't speak was on the TV screen
Sucking everybody mean
Because she's just a freak

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front

Callin me a balla shot calla 
'Cause I'm slangin' all the major weight 
Blam!!

Po-po start searchin' low, but found no evidence, 
They tryin' to wash me an our county like Downy, 
Quick to pick a nigga Nack up like Downty, 
Don't clown me, 
Bitch!! 
Dike hoes want to lick my clit, 
But end up gettin' stuck in the gut, wit a dick, 
Down fo my shit, 
Tricks want to get em up wit me, 
Because they heard their baby-daddy fucked wit me, 
But I'm out on you hoes, 
Wit the 10 g belt, 
The only thing I'm concentratin' on is checkin' my mail, 
What the hell??!! what the fuck??!! 
Do you mean, 
Your boyfriend is a dope fiend, an he smoked up all my ice cream, 
Oops upside yo head fo gettin licked like a lolli-pop, 
Let yo nigga cut, where's my shit, now you get lolli-hopped, 
By everybody on the turf, 
Oh yeah about that skrilla hell yeah that welfare check is mines on

An I can't tell you why the funk be deep! 
Do you really know where ya going to,

Fuck around an trust yo underfolks, 
Like dope fiends, you leave yo cream wit, 
Post, you come back an yo whole bundle gone, 
Or this, niggaz add dirt to the list, 
Getaway clean, 
But one want to keep everything, 
He gots to cook it, 'cause we need the good shit to post, 
Tryin' to bake a whole thing, this fool claim that the pot broke, 
But here goes 5 g's an dubbs, 
You can probably catch mo 'cause I chop slugs, 
Blood bubbles, so I charge it to the game wit no shame, 
Even though we got away wit a whole thang of cocaine, 
I got fucked in the deal, sumpthin' cool, 
(Why meee!!) 
'Cause that 5 g's he gave me was boo-boo, 
Too much drama in the streets of the Oak, 
Niggaz will tell you what they want you to hear, 
Not what you should know, 
Instead of sellin' mo cream, 
Niggaz is sellin' mo dreams, 
Lyin' juss to kick it sellin' weight wit no fiends, 
Now this is sumpthin' that I don't understand, 
Why the fuck would that nigga Master P call himself the Ice Cream Man, 
Bitch!! Don't you hear the muzik?? 
That's jankie as fuck, 
He musta been off the fluid, 
Niggaz steadily tryin' to take shit from the next man, 
Don't playa hate, juss give a pound an let the best stand, 
It's too much skrilla in the Land, 
Fo niggaz to be hatin', 
Captain Savin, 
I juss don't understand. 

'Cause when I was a youngsta, money was so damn hard to find. 
But dealt wit my young comrads an we was deadly on the grind. 
When I wanted to bubble, fools start trippin' talkin' shit. 
They never woulda thought I'd be, the mutha fuckin' wit all of the grip. 

Check this out here you jive ass turkeys man. Hoe's slobberin-obberin' in 
The O. There's only one Mobb man, don't hop on the back of the Ice Cream 
Truck an get yo ass booted off.

Lay low, 'cause my four-four, 
Will make yo ass glow, like Bruce Lee woo, 
(Sho nuff) 
Since they bigga, 
Many figga that I can't throw, 
But they don't know about this bole-legged skinny nigga, 
Mad because I'm foldin' grip, 
Plus rollin' thick, 
Still up on that late night loadin clips, 
Holdin' shit, 
To myself, 
Shotgun bullets be bad fo them health, 
So save that gang-bang shit on somebody else, 
Where I peep thugs, 
Have drugs to sell you, 
Don't fuck wit the L-you-N-I-Z that's what they tell you, 
Peep the murder we wrote,

This shit is to be to let go,
So welcome to the ghetto,
Got no love from my moms an pops had to creep an caulk heat wit my 
Fellows,
Niggaz from the Big O,
Always down to scuffle,
Had the hustle from the get go,
An didn't no body, give a fuck about Jerold,
Not when I had hella dirt an lint in my dried up ass curl,
Hit the dice game,
Hurled off the night train,
So hang that four-fifth at my brain,
If you want me to do the right thang,
Ever since my eyes open,
I musta really sell dope in,
The 6-9 Village of East Oakland,
Hopin',
My dad would come back,
But that fool vamp,
Now my mama spend the checks on woozy's an the food stamps,
That's why my ass was pumpin' gas, 
An shootin' craps,
So I can make me some rootin' tootin' scratch,
No dap from the school hoes,
Now why did I cut school,
Fuck school,
'Cause me didn't have no school clothes,
I had to go,
Hook up, a book up,
Now I'm a crook up,
On the late night posted,
Slangin' cakes like Hostess,
Sumpthin' ferocious,
Mo candy than Reese Pieces,
Fo human species,
That want to swap fo T.V.'s an V.C.'s,

Like Heav D, nuttin' but love fo ya,
Fedi dubbs fo ya,
The only nigga would glove fo ya,
It's me,
The ice creamery,
So weasel down the Yellow Brick Road while I fold the greenery.

[Chorus : x2]

You wonder why I became the ice cream mMan,
'Cause I knocked straight hands,
But niggaz on my block didn't understand,
That I was born to be a factor,
If roses what I play, to get paid,
Then don't fade,
But first give a nigga props,
Fo ditchin' cops,
I couldn't work,
So I knew a nigga couldn't stop,
Slangin' mo yay than the next man,
If I come up, don't get mad,
Juss give a pound an let the best stand,
'Cause I done tried gettin' twenty off a note,
I been there, slangin' fo the next nigga still broke,
He flippin' shit, but you ain't,
You fuck around an crumble,
Then you come up short on yo bundle,
An plus the dope fiends be gafflin',
Rolled out all yo scratch,
You broke, so you whips up a dangle batch,
To get enough to cop a zip,
I'm stackin' up my grip,
Got my .380 out so I don't slip,
I need some real folks to come up,
Niggaz wit some guts,
Plots an set up shop, wit Dru an Yuk,
My lick mates,
Hundred percent hustlaz,
Games an heists,
Quick to lick a niggaz house on bikes,
Twice the game, bigga the endin',
Endin' rules,
Much shit, an tucked tens is what I'm sendin' fools,
I goes through all shit,
To lick a ball bitch,
To law shit,
Then I'm off wit the Lootchie,
My game is ready to be sold,
I got my stripes fo followin' the Yellow Brick Road.

Now I'm the ice cream man,
Bitch,
Don't you see the man sittin on gold ones,
Dishin' off half, zips, an whole ones,
No one,
Could stop the Operation Stackola,
A black soldier slangin' crack only fo scratchola,

Straight over nighter,
Then flag the driver down wit my flash lighter,
""He speak please g, please don't say no to me, fo the cream, I dream, I 
Fiend like Jodeci!""
Notice he had a G ready to spend it,
Splended,
Got my shit so I won't get apprehended,
Once again it's on,
I gets my bail on,
Weasel down the Yellow Brick Road wit hoes an my mail on.

Seems like the whole block is holdin' now,
Broke my triple beam, 'cause the whole scene is rollin' now,
Hope I can get to break it down an hold thangs, wit my luck,

Nut up wit nuthins,
Stroll down the Yellow Brick Road,
Quick to lick fo some paper to fold,
Stole my whole load,

I'm broke, you broke, we all broke
So let's take our broke asses to the sto'
And steal another bottle of X.O.
I'm feelin so faded, broke wit a album
But bitches on my dick like I ate it
I'm use to smellin fish, but not that kind
Look you's a hoochie, want to do me, 
At least try to act fine
Cause I'm the nigga wit the best hand
You poochie, you look like my pitbull
Stretched the fuck out your stretch pants
You fuckin up my drunk a lot high
You get the drunk talk, dick feelin right, right, right
All I need is X.O. to set me in

Suckin all on my doobie, be poppin coochie

Then she said do you got the rubber
Got the cover's out the closet
Another flawless victory, a bitch ain't shit to me
She was history, soon as my nigga Nut come threw
Wit Num, Dru, Chris, and Richie Rich we on some new shit
I know this, bitch was a groupie from the giddy-go
Really though, want to be all in a nigga video
But silly ho, you know you got to fuck all us
Pimps, playa's, hustla's, balla's
Shot caller's call the shots, top knotch blazin
Got a cock caved in like saquash stopim raisin's
Stay in the ho, so fa sho runned a train

Why do brothers bump they gums and debate on me
Why when I ride by and don't stop
You feel I disrespected your block

If you had a top-notch lezbo, straight from Peanuts
Sexin', tell me would you hit it without protection, uh uh
Let's make it harder, what if she had a friend
Both down for nut huggin, off the Hen, would you spend

Chips, what if I come off the hoe with six-six
Will I get back in the mix, drop some grip, or just quit
What if O.J. verdict was different thing
Would we swing, start lootin' and shootin' with Rodney King

If it was a fifth, would you share it with ya folks
So we could ride out and get smoked
I wonder if I dropped a hundred dollars would you give it back (no)
I wonder if we cool like that (hell no)

You got three cute flees, one fine, one got a job, one with patience
What would you dick for a long term relation
Money is the thing, fine ones can start hatin
I'm broke so I need one with patience

If I was hella dirty, look like Mr. Furley, 
With lint up in my curly hair
Would you groupie-ass girlies stare
What if I didn't have a car to skee-skirt in
Would you still be flirtin' or would it be curtains

If you got your teeth knocked out, would you re-freak the old ones
Or rush to the dentist for some gold ones
If you had forty dollars, and a hooker wanted thirty
Could we catch you out in Vegas doin' dirty

If you got one gritty and five niggas
Would you speak on the choo-choo shit to make the situation bigger
She'll do it, but now she on some new shit
You gotta go down town, enjoy the fluid

[Chorus]

How many blunts must I take to the face to be straight, forty
If I don't got five on the eighth would you fake or, smoke it
Get loaded or hold it like a buster to get cluster
Should I be rollin' with big hustlers

Would I take one and a heisteses
Want to bubble, but you can't keep up with the prices

And then I ask you, what if I sold a million plus
Should I renegotiate with that nigga Russ

Man, why ya'll still knockin'!?
I'm fed up wit that
Now I think ya'll plottin'
Tryin' to case my house
Scopin' out my cabbage (it's cool!)
I should start shootin' folks in the ass hole
'Cause I'd a told 'em before, but they still come at will
So now this time, I think that some blood should spill
It ain't juss dudes it's hoes too
My house ain't the spot!
Smellin' up my crib wit yo dirty ass cock
My broad findin' out is what I'm fearin'
Showin' up wit out notice, leavin' photos and earrings
People knockin at my door, it ain't me it's different strokes
So you can go on, leave and get yo Note 
Playa hatas
Betta save a, quarter
So you can hit me on my pager
Keep comin' and I'm a mow ya
'Cause I

[Chorus]

One and a two and a three
Hoes want to do it to Num, Dru and me
She screw me and do me like V.V.D.
A hoochie
Poppin' that coochie like an O.G. off the VSOP
And you know we had to work that fat ass orgy!
When I was on the turf, hoes used to smirk and straight ignore me
Now it Georgie-Porgie, put in pie
Couldn't I
Be in yo video half naked doin' the butterfly?
Wit some other guy tattooed straight on your titty
A pretty
Freakin' all the ballers in the city
You tried to rigg me
But once it's done, once a hoe
8 months pregnant, but you know we did it 4 months ago
And yo!
I had the J the I the M
So whoever went wrong you betta ask them
And baby I ain't the one
And I couldn't of.

The Luniz,"Mammy  zammy  damn there's nothin to me 
But when they rock us in the streets we say ""Ooo we"" 
You see the freak in the beat  she do me 
I hit that mitty bitty wit the sticky ooo we gooy 
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe 
I got more soul in my style 
Then they will ever know 
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show 
We got them groceries bro 
Yo Luniz let go. 

I got the flow so let the Luni man take over 
Get deep into my hold 
If ya lost, then picture gold 
I heard styles that others stole 
But it's no original flow 
Like the Luniz an the man wit the nose. 

Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11 
Ghetto heavy, could climb wit mo ""Good Times"" than James Devin

Homies in the hood, we strap Rugers an ""We Got More"".

Hold you, from the O-we-O-we-O. 

I got that Voodoo runnin through my veins 
Quit 
Suppressed yes 
Crazy no 
Not insane 
I smoothie through the menu then I make my order 
I got that dominate gene 
So if ya 'noid hide yo daughter 
The love ya givin is based on what I do for you 
For the right amount of money you probably let me ??? you 
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride 
Ain't no whore 
Don't second guess yo man 'cause he got more. 

Studio gangstas want to battle, well let's battle

Then move away so they won't be called haters.

One, drink a lot, all day

Five, smoke a lot, all day
(Twenty)

You know what I came to do
Came to drink wit a gold face same as you
Drop a fifty on the bar for a fifth of Hindu
Got freaks wit me, gotta get gin too

I know hoes think the same as me
Because they came to the club lookin' like freak nasty
Pullin' niggaz on the floor, dance nasty as you wanna
Rub a dub, dub, lap dance in the corner

Same old shit, same old hits, same old click, same old dick
Bitch, don't look in my eyes, 'cuz I ain't payin'
Ya shoulda known pimpy doo, niggaz, ain't playin'

Just pull down yo' drawls, so a nigga can see
'Cuz I doubt that the pussy is fuckin' wit me
Pop a coochie to the back, pop a coochie to the front
But damn, open yo' thighs, pick up my nigga blunt

What ya really want, what ya really need?
Pop the breaks on that shit and let's get keyed
Girl, I always pictured you in neon lights
Big 44, double D's, what a sight

You and me both, we can get respect
Two triple shots of hen and we'll be on deck
You my type, you old hoe, you my type, you know

Why bitches doggy style, nut down yo throat
Get up while my dick on yo' coat and I'm bumpin' too short

Down the block, three on fourth
My nigga Num, drunk on the porch off a muthafuckin' quart of OE
Nickle and dime ass nigga to a top hat balla, big rigga like E-Fourtee
Niggaz know me, smoke a lot, only smoke weed, blow trees
Whole keys, see me in a E-3 dub, rollin' sweet up every time you see yuk

Peep us, only bad bitches beep us
Turn yo' main squeeze into a cheata, smokin' reefa
Took off my DK's and she fucked us up wit the whole sneaka
And her pussy, lift yo ass cheeks up so I could see

Mix the hashes up wit the back yard boogie, woogie
Bust nuts on yo' Donna Carra hoodie if it's all goodie
And be a ride a Benz wit my knees, what?
Breakin' trees up, rollin' weed up on my way to the V up
To put the G's up, see yuk, hella high, tinky eyed like Korea

20 blunts a day in the dock of the bay
Niggaz, I'm scratch but they call it Killa Cali
I'm walkin' through the spot in my crocodile ballies

20 bag please, 20 deep east
I finna smoke a stanky and get high as a tree
Wit my dime piece mommie, queen bee's keeper
When the bitch shake her ass, nigga, you should see her

Wit a taped on bracelet, diamond laced watches
Mossimo jeans wit her condoms in the pocket
The bitch is real bad in a drop top Jag
Sittin' on chrome shelf on paper tag

Slidin' off G-string off in a coach bag
Dolla sign eyes and a stash full of hash
Back to the side where niggaz blaze
Home of the crew and the booty shake

Straight packed club where the hoes be poppin'
Dick all hard, tryin' to shake a li'l sumthin'
Lookin' for the one that'll do me right
Who keep me cummin' all through the night

Ain't no pitty if you fall to your knees
Fuck me, suck me but nigga, please
Let a nigga hit it, bitch, I know you wit it
From the back 'cuz my dicks all in it

I stick it in like it ain't no thang

Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-you-you-ff your hoes

(Numskull)
This rap here goes to all you player haters 
Hand cuff your hoes, that goes to all you Captain Save-Hers
Me, my major industries gold teeth and diamonds
Been grindin' for nine and half years now I'm rhymin'
Reclinin' meal tickets couldn't be lookin' me in the eye
I'm sigh now, clown that ass like Saturday Night Live (WHHHYYYY!)
Because I'm all between they wife's thighs
But all jokes aside I yoke the ride and roll the weed up at the same time
While I drive I cross my heart and hope to die
Hella high, it's the mobb blowin' greenery till we die
So haters do me a favor, handcuff your briide
I creep through when your husband's at the job
Many hunners got players, baby mammas feedin' me all kinds 
of hibachi shrimp and I don't even rock Versacci pimpin dudes
But when I'm through, you never knew I touched her
Got her screamin loud as hell like Chris Tucker (aaaaah!)
Handcuff your hoes

(The Luniz)
When I step in the house (niggas snatch they hoes up quickly)
Niggas start breakin' out (cause they all want to get with me)
Cause they know they hoes ain't faithful (and my eyes is on them all)
And I'll snatch them if I'm able (hey, put this lighter on the balls)
Olly-olly-oxenfree, don't hesitate to give your hoes to me

(Numskull)
Uh, I'm used to stabbin' top notch and border coochies
Just big booty, firm casabas, preferably groupies (WITH BIG THIIIGHS!)
Makin' em ride they self up the wall easy
Off the expecting them, feel breezy
Do me a favor, take your hoes (HOME)
Before you find your breezy (GONE)
It'll be for life, only players when I'm beerin' at
I want the better things in life
Nice, he ain't hearin' that
I ain't the nigga to be buyin' bitches clothes
they know that and still keep
So handcuff your hoes (handcuff your hoes)

(Chorus: The Luniz)
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-you-you-ff your hoes (your hoes)

Hey Mrs. Big Butt (why you always cry?)
She fight all the time (Oh my, my, my)
He's been cheatin' on you, but don't worry, please dry your eyes
Just take a ride with smoke-a-lot, the master of high
(HOW HIIGGH!), high enough to kiss the sky, on the real
I wonder why beautiful girls date fat guys
He must got his cape on tight, oh look up in the sky
(WHHHYYY!), now that's a Captain Save-Her fo' sure
Me being like that no, no, no, no, no
I know some hoes don't want to be a dumb-dummy
but don't play around and disrespect my money
Like a gun I'll take you away
And if you niggas act a fool, I'll spray you with the AK
Just let me take the hoe (and go peacefully)
Let me skip into the sunset (like tweed-de-lee-de-lee)
I like to come and so do you
If you can take one nut then you can take two
And it's true, we likes to party (TO PARTY!)
We likes to party

[Verse 1]
Baby tell me is it cool to touch me before we room it up
Do you need the strawberry booms to fuck
cut up the tunes and bump
What up my name is Yukmouth
But that don't mean I eat the pussy hole and butt out
or you could get the fuck out my vehic
Cause, eating your pussy I can't see it
A million other bitches I could be wit
believe it, see it ain't allowed in the Lexo
don't talk that way
I'll drop your ass half a block away from the ghetto
with the club via Freak Nasty
Debbie doesn't but drinking niggas bubble up Freak Nasty
pass me that baggy of doe doe
global conversation on the mo mo, dig this

If you would like to blow the endo
lets go Holiday Inn in the ego
open the no smoke out the window
roll back to back when I'm in on my business

Is it cool to fuck?

If not just suck

[Verse 2]
Billy, put your seatbelt on
I ain't got no bills
plus once up the ass and the streets full of Tash
(I just shake my ass) that ain't gonna work
But it will for me, let's see, pull up your skirt
Let me feel the monkey, it kinda smells
You fine but you gotta take a shower at the 'tel
lets skate, blaze the hep, crack the Henny, here, hit that
Don't, that's a no, give it back
Damn, you ever met a bitch that need a muzzle
I got some gin in the back you can guzzle
By the way what's your motherfuckin name?
(You forgot already?) Shit, I just cross reference with game
Change your train of thought
I was taught to speak now and ask questions later
Cause bitches quick to catch the vapors

Baby tell me is it cool to fuck
but you already knowin
its 5 o'clock in the mornin
where the fuck you think we going yet bitch

how we creep in Vineto 600 this week though

sit your asses
look at mesmorizes eyes that twinkle
bitches astounded by the Chinese and Peroneco
hey you, hit the shower
towels in the back, check it
and when you done bring your ass out here

surround by sounds coming out the walls
my little freak nasty bitch start coming out her drawers
and all and all
she like to eat dick, a can of balls and her jaws
go down the chimney with Santa Clause

Where's my bitch? Three plus one equals four
naked motherfuckers, big orgies on the floor
bitches knees sore, rug burns, broken lamp shades
What a party these tramps made

I remember when we was hella broke dude
We just had a dream, right?
We made it happen dude

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

We used to be short on the avenue so broke on the avenue
I couldn't afford to have a brew
How it happened dude, just me and you
I use to drink brew after you

You had your daughter first, my baby son was born right after you
Now we making cash with Dru, oh look what havin' cash would do
Playahatas come after you, if they blast at you
I'd be the first one to prove what the mass would do

One ain't better than havin' two, looney individuals off cash and brew
Lace the avenues boy I ain't mad at you
Hindu drinkin' glass with you, cheers
We lasted through years what we have to do

We finally here, I got 5 showed on the Billboard Live
Doin' songs with Too Short, courtesy of Jive
Front page of the Vibe, live and direct,
Rafael Saadiq freak that beat chorus and drumset
Make your ears wet like sex, who waitin to come next
With Pavey Rolex, just me and you

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

We risked it and killed in Cali before we make bread
Creating our heaven on earth but it's worse we cursed from birth
Now turn money and keepin' moms happy
Got me gladly livin lavelle, I say we blessed to have mail

Big Willie, I'm numb to the world baby
Don't speak among thangs unless it pays me
You never see Yuckmouth weighin circumstances
You never see Numbskull flossin takin chances

Advancement is okay doe and cheatin is alright
And it's best to have some killa's on the payroll, day and night
Stick and move pick and choose licks
Benet wasn't in it that's why Benet didn't benefit

Believe my story the tale of glory didn't make me believe
That in America I never had to worry
Cupid wasn't stupid but never was Numb and Yuck
It was all dreams and wishes, game and luck
Just me and you

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

It was gonna happen man
First we got 5 on it, now we got 5 on big beats
Rafael Saadiq, DJ Quik, G 1, that's how it happened man
Once you get large do your thang, big thangs man

Hey, when you saw my show in '94 you didn't know
We'd blow like Nitroclycerin, Girbaud, Tommy Hill, Timberland
Playboy, I use to rock a pendelton, officer arrests a gentleman
Now I'm spending big deusch marks on German women

In the red light district way out in Amsterdam kickin it
Adam and Eve coffee shop, purchase grams wicked
Disappeared like the grand wizard dig it
Trying to be the richest young black brothas in the business

I heard so many times it was hopeless, bogus
Accordin' to both of us the world was untouched
We had to focus, I had to explain thangs to the fullest
Figured out what we could and couldn't

And made plans to get the puddin'
There's too many rules to made and broke
The mail is to be made so lets fade a toast
Now tell these folks to let me be all I can be
So the L U N I Z will go down is history

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again

Stress, that's all y'all hear, I like a bag of stress
(Is that right?), baby mamma's own
Speak on this, uh

My baby mamma, why y'all be crazy daily
Hit us up with drama, playin with babies
And tryin to break your player partners
Wonder why we blaze weed and steadily smokin marijuana?
Your baby mamma, YOUR MAMMA!

(Yukmouth)
My baby mamma, probably been screwed 
by so many dudes that she's confused
Keep makin moves and breakin fools and V-12's like you and I
I flew in high of Endo and I.C.E.
That baby's supposed to look like me
Girl, youse a lie, now who's them eyes?
Where did he get that big-ass hair-fro?
Lookin like a baby macks hair-drum, huh
Platinum, until my bread come
So she can try to sue me and do me
like they did my man Num, my baby mamma
The typical groupie, she watch me go from 
squattin the hoopie, to clockin loochie and the prowl
I see woman livin me coochie like, catch (catch)
Go, go smoke-a-lot Rolex stretch in the crowd, grab a bitch, ey
Throw up your hands if you're H-O-support
Throw up your hands if you're going to court hey
The life that you live is long not short hey
Dig it, you catch a nigga like me smokin weed
on the porch with your baby mamma

To get me back behind my back
She probably fuck my partner 
but you can have her player partner
Yo, cause I forgot, my baby mamma (YOUR MAMMA!)

(Numskull)
My baby mamma, not dat, different from many same schemes
To conceive a nigga baby and basically fuck up everything
Bring your whole castle to ruins
If you don't see your baby in my presence then I'm suing
I knew you was scandalous, man-less, but I took a chance though
Now every time a nigga get paid, I see your hands hoe (ice that dough)
You stick the D.A. on me, and even worse than that
you got my little baby daughter thinkin daddy phony
But will she grow up; you tell her your faulty tales
When you took my essence, I check and spent all the mail
I was in jail, you told lies to my mum
Scooped the next nigga and sucked him at the prom
Now I'm, going to court for welfare-back payments
Because I didn't keep receipts and bank statements
I got the lead on ya, you only daddy's little girl
because I think your daddy's sweet on ya

Your baby mamma's they come in all shapes and sizes
With little surprises in their bellies
They use it to buy Christelly Chanelle jellies
and ounces of smelly al-greenery, smokin out the whole scenery
My baby mamma, the craziest bra since my wife
At night, she the type to go sleep walkin with a knife
like Jason Nikitcha, tryin to slit ya wrist and the bitch wit'cha
Did ya forget its been three years since I fucked wit'cha (bitch)
Quit fuckin' my high off
Quit showin up at shows askin for dough fuckin my life off
Listen my boss players' haters, let the playboy 
smoke-a-lot for nature, lace, modulate ya (hey)
Tie you shoes on these down-home blues
Out of all the woman I choose
Your baby mamma look like boo-bleh
I got some top notches I know you do to
But nine times out of ten your baby mamma look like boo-boo nigga

We mess with phillies, we roll big phillies.
(I want to get blunted, my brother.)

Suppress the brown bitch, up in the Crown Vic's.
Spread her legs and put the greenery lips around it.
Gets around it while niggas quit. (Woah!)
This bitch look better than Whitney, lick her titties,
'Cause niggas say the pussy be the stick-icky.
One puff'll turn your brain cells to dust.
Head rush, bound to fill your eyes up with the redness.
Suck her up, but there's a million bitches just like her.
Even dykes try to fuck her in the cypher, with the lighter.
Puttin' the dick on the ass an', everybody cashin, black 'n
Latino motherfuckers know they be mashin'
Nigga like whas' happenin'?
You can keep them sassy, the dickey used to.
Nicky Bone to top, to dump the hash in.
My partners, they be askin': Mr. Y-U-K,
Why you stay high off the hash and be smashin'?
With a hundred gun and a hundred click.
To the sto', they get phillies.
To we get blunted as we want to get.

[Chorus]

I takes my gat with a phillie, I don't need no quote.
Now boss player, this is how I like to blow my smoke.
I grab the phillie, cut the throat, jump to the back
Of a building, top player, makin' a little bits with a cup up of spit.
It makes me sick and upset when it's spit and silly.
Whenever you phillie, its all spitty and wet.
It doesn't matter, rich or po', I couldn't care less, bro.
It mixes when I'm out and let the motherfucker smoke no ho.
I shake the bud, mary-tramps, the one that tried to shove the weed up the fifth,
Without givin' up no cocker food stamps.
I know they want it, but smokin' for free, I don't condone it.
Don't put your crusty lips on it if you ain't got no chips on it.
I spent a grip on it, and girl, the cuffs out here.
And if you floss out here, you take a loss out here.
You're doin' too much catin' in the cypher wit'cha.
Lighter, tryin' to flick your big, if you ain't got no skits, you can't get hit.

How many blunts do you blow on the daily?
Many money, I blow many, many, many.
I smoke plenty. (Well, won't your black ass quit being stingy?)
I'm not greedy. (Well, where's that weed fiend?)
(You better quit smokin' those beadys in my fo', hun.)
(Blow one for the po' one.)
(Nigga, don't you owe one?  Act like ya know one.)
No one does it better, break it down with my thumbs.
(Fuck the zigzags, and stack your lungs, make the runs.)
But no fund, no gas money.
(Well, even if a dummy has money.)
(He'll be a dumber dummy then bin his ass money.)
My blunt is my keeper, like cash money.
Blast money, stash money, the last money was considered.
Bombs, stick, green grass money.
Roll, but next time, I'm a put a little to the side. (Hash money.)

Hey nigga, I started smellin' weed and hella weed,
Then I started sellin' weed.
Bitch be tellin' me, they want to smoke.
To catch Mozik than a spellin' bee,
'Cause I smoke they ass under the table.
The hos' stable, pass me that cigarette or phillie.

I got that feelin' again, let's smoke that acrylin'.
Again, I said you willin' again, then we can walk the Poppa-ceiling again.
I storms in like a mighty blast of wind.
Inhale, exhale, the phillies rule my dome an'... (Aaahhh!)

Fuck around and smoke the sprayed up.

Smellin' like ass hemp's and grine, cocky mouth.
Chap lips, fuckin' off all the poo-nanny.
If why'all gonna smoke, I'll be the designated weed roller.
Call me Numboy, the motherfuckin' seed roller.
But you gotta crack the window, though,
'Cause me and the lads like Whoopi Goldberg, in centerfolds.
Drink-a-lot, never like to think-a-lot.
Nigga, I don't smoke no more 'cause I don't like the stank-a-lot.

Nigga, I'm drink-a-lot, smoke-a-lot too, nigga.
Fuck, how you gonna say that shit, nigga, if you be smokin' cigarettes? (Fuck y'all.)

Welcome
Little boys and girls, listen
A man can get caught up in things (Right)
It's like a gridlock (Right)
He gots ta have it (ugh ugh), his girl got his mind (ugh ugh)
Took over his whole body, he needs her (Speak on it)
He can't live without her (Ugh!), dig this

Her name was Lady Heroin, I think he met her at a Chevron
Late night stressin he caught his wife sexin with his cousin Stefan
He told his wife to get to step on
before I start lettin loose on your skanless ass with the weap-on
Then since he's learnt, involved in a three year marriage
Arguin, fightin with his wife at night, arrested by sheriff
Embarrassed, handcuffed, go to jail in your drawers
and all of this because his wife tried to put the knife to his balls
And oh naw, cock the seat uhh, she tried to straight Lorraine Lee Bobbit me
I woke up out of a dream, she was on top of me
Screamin that's how it gotta be, holdin a dagger
I grabbed my gat, point it at her, she dropped the dagger, I slapped her
Months after he got out of jail, seriously hooked on girl
Lips chapped, face pale, body skinny and frail
Tales of a married man whose life was stressed too much
Had to resort to snortin drugs and such just to keep in touch
with himself, his wife suin for half of the wealth (uhh)
And all that shootin in his veins was gettin bad for his health
His cards was dealt, methamphetamines on the shelf
Smokin the creamery, the greatest thing the man ever felt
Now he's high, pull over on the bridge ???
Ready to die, he took his last swig of Reynell
A livin hell, he climbed on the rail then he yelled
""God all my life I failed"" as he slipped and fell, oh girl

	[Chorus]
	Why'd you have to do me that way?
	I love you til this day
	Even stinks to think you're the one we used to stay
	Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
	I'll never give you up
	Never seemed to act touchable, that was the start

[Crooked I]
She was a gangsta ass bitch, the greatest of all time
She took my heart and my mind, turned me to a life of crime
Now I'm, under pressure to impress her
I wake up, put on my bullet proof vestin
grab my Smith & Wessin off the dresser
then I, hop up in a chopped up rag Tre
When I, cross your path you're havin a bad day
'cause I, make the automatic mag spray
Gimme the cash, she taught me to get mine the fast way
I creep on ballers while they blaze joints
I'm snatchin caine boulders and jackin Range Rovers at gauge point
Under hypnosis, robbin the closest nigga
The diagnosis - psychosis, the cirrhosis is from doses of liquor
that I'm sippin by the picture, tryin to ditch ya
but when ever she get dug, the bitch'll be witcha for richer
or poorer, through sickness and health
Eyewitness, if I shake this mistress I can handle business myself
But I love her so much I'm stuck in her clutches
I talk about her, can't walk without her, she's my crutches
She showed a young nigga how to check grip
Connectin me with the correct licks to collect chips
And if I leave her, no question I'm destined to hurt
And she's the reason half of the homies are restin in dirt
It's Crooked I next, I'll probably get dropped by some metal (some metal)
Just for comin around my girl (who?), the ghetto (my girl)

	[Chorus]
[Knumskull]
I'm curbside, and my girl sellin graciously
Never no worries, and if Task kick, we skeet and scurry
I'm posted up makin my squillion
My mind set - I don't stop til I get a million
But I'm seein baby momma's and grandpas gettin double
Legit, that ain't my problem 'cause I bubble
I always wonder why friends came back for mo' and mo'
The high was fantastic, smelt like plastic but it's dope
Scope the area before I made moves, losin gains
was the up-and-downs in this so-called game but hey
Take the punches and blows, put aside, the crack babies
Dope fiend mommas and nasty hoes, peep
I'm walkin around the spot with a bundle in my mouth
Yay leakin through the plastic in drastic amounts
I'm feelin wide eyed, probably lookin like a tweaker
Spit the bundle in my palm, and tried to keep calm
My dove shrunk down, to tens, I'm high off crack
and damn, it didn't really feel bad
Started thinkin, this use to be a rich man high
I gotta high drug tolerance so I'll give it a try
Went home and did my thang, snatched a two hundred bundle for keeps
The shit was so good I was Pookie for two weeks
Luckily, I bounced back, but I stopped sellin cream
Now this is like one big dream, oh girl

The Luniz,"Verse 1 *(Numskull)*
Once upon a time, steppin on the scene
a dope-related youngsta, rappin hella clean
a cool type of stance, don't trip where he's from
to make interestin it's me Nummy-Num
I lived on Ave. what no one ever had
broke wit no be	-i's feelin hella sad
I lied
I stole
always hella bold
but I make no progress, never reachin no goals
my potnas they used to, smash and bash
talkin trash wit no remorse cappin on my raps
even worse than that to make me feel low
they drunk all they Hin, and smoked all the dope
and girls used to say ""Num you're so cute""
""but you get's no action 'cause you have no loot""
well one day walkin down Six-Duce
I seen a brother wit Shelly he's lookin hella juiced
he said ""Here ye here ye, check out my thang""
""if you can rap real good and got songs you can hang""
""I already got a rapper Dru Down I'm bout to start""
""you can rap on his tape if you can rip it apart""
so I ran home and wrote a new song
the tape went platinum it didn't take hella long
got a couple of checks and I, brokes out
moved to Hollywood, now they think I sold out.

*(Chorus-Luniz, Cydal & T Luni)*
Uh.
When you makin mo mail then they could
hatas think you goin Hollywood
Never would, Hollywood.
When you move up out the hood
hatas think you goin Hollywood.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Verse 2 *(T Luni)*
All right stop what ya doin
'cause I'm about to ruin
the image of the game that ya used to
I look bummy
but peeps I'm makin money see
so yo world are you ready for me
now gather 'round, I'm the new playa in town
if you got mo grip then me, then I lay you down
I drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf
so step aside, it's time to introduce myself
I'm T the Luni
surrounded by doobies
condoms and groupies, love me more then they do Lucchi
(you do your thang)
an all the notches in the top ten
please allow me to do it
I'm a freak, I like the girls wit the boom
I once got busy in the studio bathroom
I'm crazy
straight gangsta mack
I only stay if baby got back
I'm serious
they want to swallow me like licorice
I never faze back, girls they too ticklish
an wouldn't ride no hoochie in the hood
they think I'm too good, rumor has it that I'm Hollywood.

*(Chorus)* x1
Verse 3 *(Cydal)*
I can't be broke 
I inhale too much bomb smoke
the game is savage, makin cabbage in the city of dope
when I'm home I'm writtin songs, an I don't stop
nobody step up, or press up, when I set up shop
I used to stand in the crowd, watch the dope fiends an wonder
man who them fools in the ice cream van
that's Nummy-Num and Yuk trick, don't you hear the music?
playas always haven't, but playa hatas use it
been out for the cash since the day I was born
til I changed it, rearranged it to a street game form
I write a rhyme, anger feedin 'em
every show you see me in
deep in M.O.B., 'cause ain't no folks surviving greediness
fiends being wild, so they need to be tamed
so I keep 'em all in shackles, 'cause they gotta be chained
then I'm back to the honey comb
where hustlas get they money gone
Oakland ain't no joke, we all no it ain't no funny bone
a public enemy
not even a friend of me
the Mobb, will stand beyond the click that why'all pretend to be
so don't be givin me this and that about the hood
'cause they know it's all good
I never could go Hollywood.

*(Chorus)* x1
Verse 4 *(Yukmouth)*
I play the landlord, you be the apartment
you all know my name Smoke-A-Lot I gotta spark it
to get yo bitch started
who roll the hardest
me as the artist I gotta come out the largest
Yuk, I squat a Lexo's an Num's squattin Pala's
it ain't about who ballin 'cause we all clockin dollas
that's why 
I packed as an eagle
people be lookin at me smokingly roll by bomb-beagles
rap is like a kilo, of cocaine
illegal business and we in this dope game
buying so-an-so I'm a playa, I'm a mack
huh, but to me you ""geek-geek"" off crack
I smoke sacks wit the purple heads around from the Town
put that backyard boogie down,
you puffin wit Yuk, you know I blow greenery
you want to be like me the Ice Creamery
if yo ass ain't know by now I hits the scenery
so cleanery, sittin on chrome eighteeneries
I smoke a beedie, a tampa to the wood
mainly what I write is for the homies in the hood

Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s

Rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like Ping Pong,
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong,
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40,
And when it comes to get another stogie,
Fools all kick in like Shinobi

The Luniz,"I think it was Friday night, I met her at the club
Apple Martini-ed up, smokin bud with my thugs
Then yo yo, there she was, très bon booty ( *French* )
Like Beyoncé no fiancé, let's keep in touch
I wanted to beat it up, cause she was a superbad
I mean with all that ass, same night hit it that fast
We at her mega pad, still diggin like a sav'
We poppin x tabs, the head was extra lav'
But this her baby dad and he don't live with her
And at his grandma's pad they left the kids with her
So that explains the pictures I see of this nigga
She says she's low on scrilla, she wanted gifts for her
So she can get her nails done and get her weave fixed
And I can't stand no nappy hair bitch
And so I break off bread, nothin but pocket change
She blew my socks again and then I hopped in the Range
And then she kept on askin for bread, like everyday
""My children need some aspirine, I got some bills to day""
Now what am I to say, cause Yuk, he love the kids
Puffy sell millions, but Yuk, he love the kids
So I broke off bread, I did it for the kids
Never trust a bitch, never think Yuk a trick
I got the slut dismissed, she got the dismissal
I ain't fuckin with you, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny

Time after time, rhyme after rhyme
I look around, some hoe after mine
But I'm just steady on the low, steady 'bout my flow
Why try to keep a hoe steady when they be steady wantin mo'?
I don't want no hoe all on my back, all up in my sack
Before I burn one, at every corner that I turn on
Hoe, get a life ? boppin' all night like you a nigga
Need to be at home with yo damn children
Like that shit was cool, well ain't shit cool
About your children missin school
Because you done cut a fool at the club last night
And you ain't ? six
Ran into a couple of ballers cappin like you broke them tricks

5 dollar bill on the real before it's history

Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos

Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slo',
So the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bra

But they know they got to pitch in,
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no, you betta' bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that
Better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know ya got Asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, an guzzle it,
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely

You fade, I face, so let's head to the east
Hit the stroll to 9-0 so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget

Foggy windows, soggy Indoe
I'm in the 'land getting smoked wit my kinfolk

Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm da roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, 'cause where I be, we need half like um-foo-foo

It just feels right touching your hair.
It just feels right to hold onto what we felt before.

And greet the stale, cold air every morning.

Overanxious just to get there.

""What in the world are they running from,
And what am I running from?""

We were groating on the barrow, everything were alright,
Then the smell like a dog took me mind from sex,
I said ""Close your legs!""

Some crack walked in and it was fuckin' fit.
So I shouted ""hey up, love""
Turned on the charm,
Showed her me belly and tattoos on me arm,
I said ""don't go to Limmogy's, have chips instead""

And I changed to a real Macc Lad.

I got a tattoo and a moustache,
And me car got a go-faster stripe,
And now I pull crack every night.

The Maccabees,"Drinking when you're drunken 
To chase down the evening 
God that girl goes graceful 
Wondering which way's home
I heard nothing was changing
And that's the shirt you're wearing
No wonder no one's noticed
That the summer's been and gone
No one says a word
Because it breaks a heart
Submarine keep diving
Seagulls at the waste bins
Wish them all a winter
Must be rough at sea

He's given a bloody nose to the best friend he knows
The only time he's cried since he was seven years old 
Your best friends forgive you,
Your best friends forget you get old

Steaming at the corners
When the blue pulled over
Said he wanted seasons
Miss red hot October
The Black Maria
Is where he finds his honor
The darker the corner
Now the summer's been and gone
No one says a word because it breaks a heart
The coming and the going
Blame it on the ocean
Or coastal erosion
It must be rough at sea

The only time he's cried since he was seven years old
Your best friends forgive you,
Your best friends forget you get old, you get old

The Maccabees,"No one was crying
They simply got a little something in their eye

Watch them floating out to sea

Narrow roads, never limit, never temper, your speed
And when the river froze solid you're still swimming upstream
You'd hold your own in the presence of pauper and a king
Leave a singing bird silent, make a hummingbird sing
You are a rope-a-doper coming back queen
They all want you so bad, of course they do

Just so beautiful

You break your back for the mission because you know where you stand
You live your life to a letter writ on the back of your hand

두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터

음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade

맺힌 내 땀을 봐라

학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다

Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless,

Want a fat crib with the acres,
So they spend money that they ain't made yet,
Got a Benz on tick that they ain't paid yet,
Spend their paycheck
In the west out on a weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend.
But they don't care cause their life is a movie,
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly,
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks,
Can't keep up with the cover notes,
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit in debt

So many two-faced,
Checkin' their high sayin' they're ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the city's like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr. Politician can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it a mirage
I see youngsters die because they tryna live large
And they all say

Who cares who dares to make a change
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere's the same
Again and again I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they play sailin'
But I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession I can't front I’m in the forefront
Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom

This is how we do Brooklyn style boy
You know what I'm sayin'?

R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P A see, R.I.P n****s that wanna OD
Aiyyo, the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize n**** I'm straight from the street

These industry n****z startin' to look like somethin' to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ""You wanna see her again?""
Get your a** down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of f***in' an' are 'n' be, b****

And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your s***
When I apply pressure, son it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that n**** anytime

Have Keith sweatin' starin' down the barrel from my nine
Since these Harlem World n****z seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now""

The only excuse for being broke is bein' in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks

Plottin' to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin' to live for
Don't want no n**** puttin' four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like, ""B****, get on the ground""

You ain't with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?
I been skeamin' on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum s*** around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick

About to make Stevie J take off that tight a** mink

Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep

One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?

I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins

Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real I'm 'bout to stick Mister see
That n**** still eatin' off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor

He asked me if I had enuff I told him, ""Gimme some more""
Is you feelin' this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin' Gods People

dominicana, colombiana, let me do the honors mami

Yo, it started out in East NewYork
Where I grew up, learned how to walk
Favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers

Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar
Starvin' for mine, bust three at ya
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy

Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
Yup, that's ya Pops

Still, that's me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal 
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out

Three days away from home he come back stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big

Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
To God I pleaded

What should I do? knock your self off, but the God succeeded
And the most scariest part is you better have heart
'Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Have Faith in your God

Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black Clarion, ready to die for the family hard

Alcoholic vultures with toasters
Sheep skins on
Leather sleek Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit

Smoke a bag of wet and set it
The block we deaded
Society's grown too black and too strong to prolong
Got my Woman with a gun in her thong

It's kinda wild how we livin'
The Devil's force has risen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders

Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it

Didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my Dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx

Knowin' all along the shit was wrong 
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last, 
It keeps goin' on, so keep movin' on
Same old story, my Pops left

Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex
With around the way bitches, 
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps

Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts

Cause we’d never been in love before
With each tick-tock as the time was passed
Baby, was it built to last?

We don’t got a lot to say,
We don’t got a lot to say now lately
Don’t got a lot to say,
Cause I don’t want to hear you say you’re leaving,
You’re leaving me

If you walk away now
It won’t prove a thing
If you talk to me now
I’d say anything to keep you here with me,
But you just can’t hear when you’re always screaming
There’s only one more thing I really want to say

Just stay-ay-ay, oh-oh-oh, don’t go-oh
Stay-ay-ay, oh-oh-oh, don’t go-oh

Remember when you called me up?
I was on my way to Brixton
You told me I should listen up,
Yeah, you asked if I was listening
You said love’s a game you don’t wanna play
Cause you’ve only got one heart to break
Well the only shot that you’re sure to miss
Is the one that you don’t take

I’ll always keep you by my side

From the place I used to go
Saw a pair of head lights
And a car I didn't know

I pulled over, asked the driver
Hey man, where you going?
He said, I don't know
But I need to get there

You see, this truck is all but broken
And my life is just the same
How I even left here?
When my kid's don't know my name

I'm not trying to make excuses
Don't wanna pass on all the blame
But I don't know
How did I get here?

Say it loud
Like my mother
I can't speak
I'm too proud
Like my father

Won't you brother?

So we drove a little further
To a place I'd been before
Like cold water it hit me
When he opened up the door

To a small house in the country
There were pictures on the wall
Of places I remember
And people I recall

He said, son you're nothing like me
But I'm so glad that you're here
Then he cried and said, I'm sorry
And I've missed you all these years

And I don't know
How did we get here?
Before you go
Can we just sit here?

He said
Say a prayer

The Maddox Brothers & Rose,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana,
Rode into town one day.
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion,
And walkin' behind was a bay.
The red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder,
And his lips, they were sad and tight.
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,
And his heart was heavy as night. 
Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window,
An' watched as he passed her way.
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion,
But cast greedy eyes on the bay.
But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony,
Meant more to him than life.
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin',
Had ridden when she was his wife.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern,
An' looked up the stranger there.
He bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money,
He just didn't seem to care.
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion,
An' laughed as she grabbed at the bay.
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her,
She never heard anyone say:

""Don't cross him, don't boss him.
""He's wild in his sorrow:
""He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
""Don't fight him, don't spite him;
""Just wait till tomorrow,
""Maybe he'll ride on again.""

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset;
The stranger went free, of course.
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman,
Who's tryin' to steal your horse.
Tthis is the tale of the red headed stranger,
And if he should pass your way,
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion,
And don't lay a hand on the bay.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

They live two hundred years of love

Breaks my heart to see the highway cross the hill

And rolling and rolling down

You wanted it all

What keeps me broken in this world?

You gotta wait for her

If I fall asleep tonight

& its high time I got myself back on the rails,
I'm the lonesome cowboy, ridin across the range,
with just a hand held radio--to keep me sane,
ridin through the f.m. stations, the tumbleweed,
 & the petrol stations,
Will all on board this yankee station
Prepare themselves for battle stations--

 when he's bought his freedom
by the look of this human jungle
 It ain't just the poor who'll be bleeding!
Most everyone round here thinks they're something special
that destiny will be kind--
While they're digging for gold, diving for pearls,
& aiming for heaven from this man made world.
Come on down--the devil's in town
He's brought you sticks and stones
 to bust your neighbors bones,
he's stuck his missiles in your gardens,
& his theories down your throat--
& god knows what your gonna do with him
 'cause I certainly don't

The Magnificent VII,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She's funny that way.

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

The Magokoro Brothers,"Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I, proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, ""rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy
To memorizing politics of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now

A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school
""Equality,"" I spoke the word as if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow

That when the pretty boys try to get next to you,
They really just want to have sex with you.

It's the way you move,
And the clothes you wear,
The alcohol and the way that you don't care.
All I want to do is get next to you,
Next to you, next to you.

Your poison kiss,

Remembering the summer
It takes me back, to Southern California.

On the boardwalk and laugh
At our desperate attempts and our sunburned backs

Well never lose what we had growing up.

Won't bring us down.

The Maine,"Got caught running up a tab
Couldn't drive home so I had to share a cab
Introduced herself by her last name
The kind of girl you steal from the football team

Brought up a silver spoon mess
Always trying to tear off her Catholic dress
Told me she's over this place
Needs to feel the Midwest wind in her face

But the alcohol made its way down
She was the last thing that I saw last night before I hit the ground
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute

Had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb not giving a
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit

I did the wrong thing to the right girl
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
I've never been the best with my mouth

Try to stay smart but the dumb comes out
Maybe I'm shy, I drive an old car
Maybe I'm amazed that I got this far
And I got my stand-bys waiting on the line

But the hardest part is knowing that it won't be her this time

Thought she had it all planned out

Went to marry some guy she had talked about

But it ain't comedy when one of they arms get broke

And now to sing this lovely ballad, here is Mama Cass

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone, blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

It would come with rockets, bells and poetry

Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got
And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
And just like a flower that takes time to bloom
This love of ours is taking time to grow
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da

Cause no matter how long it takes

That it's getting better

Was she pushed, or did she jumped?

As the pussy that fell in the well
There never was a pussy that could quite compare with her
Pretty as a picture with her long and silky fur -

Well, well, well, well my cat fell in the well, well

you give my soul desire
Send me baby
Be a little crazy! Like the first
time fall in love
We read it in the stars above

The Manhattan Transfer,"3 AM
Nowhere else to go
It's 3 AM and I miss you so
Couples are departing soon they'll all be gone
Now another day is starting
Still I linger on with

Blue Champagne
Purple shadows and blue champagne
With the echoes that still remain
I keep a blue rendezvous

Bubbles rise
Like a fountain before my eyes
And they suddenly crystallize
To form a vision of you

All the plans we started, all the songs we sang
Each little dream we knew
Seems to overtake me
Like a boomerang
Blue is the sparkle, gone is the tang

It's your refrain,
Keeps returning, as I remain
With all the memories and blue champagne
To toast the dream that was you
I'm bluer than blue champagne

I saw in a jiffy that my puss was soakin' wet

My cat fell in the well

The doggone hole by the pump
Once she pushed, and in she jumped
There never was a kitty half as pretty
As the pussy that fell in the well
There never was a pussy that could quite compare with her
Pretty as a picture with her long and silky fur -

Well, well, well, well my cat fell in the well, well
Oh oh oh pussy pussy pussy poor kitty kitty kitty

Never let her wander or she might fall in a well

The Manhattan Transfer,"Let me introduce you
I've heard that boredom's entered your life
And you're feelin' real low
Have you met Benny Bailey?
Well he's a fella that you should know

They tell me lassitude's has laid you low
An' you're losin' your grip
You must meet Benny Bailey
At least he's somebody who is hip

To cure an ennui, you need a bon nuit
It's part o' the joie de vie
And his attention, I'm loathe to mention
Is, incident'ly, available

And so if providence should decree
Who'll stand in the way
So you'll meet Benny Bailey
And you'll remember your lucky day

Background Vocals: Once you've met
You won't forget
No stuff
Benny's tough
(Repeat 1,2,3)

This could be your lucky day
Incident'ly, he's the sort
Tho' seen at court
Carries an awful lotta weight
In many less royal quarters
Filled with less than regal daughters
Quite the quixotic Romeo whom every 
Filly'll know because they find his
Reputation wherever they go
Whether it's here
Or whether it's in another boudoir
Whee!
He's such a scandal, really
T' handle him demands a savoir fairer
And a great indulgence rarer
Than any that I've encountered surveyin' the scene
But never mind, I'll explain it later
The fact is that he's always ready to please
And that's aroused a lot o'chatter
But it really doesn't matter, not to him
No siree! It's 'bout as big t'him as any flea
He's gotta be maitre'd
Or so it seems to me
Wait'll why'meet, you'll see what I'm sayin'

Background Vocals: Meet this cat
He's where it's at
That's right, outta sight
Benny Bailey
He's no slouch
For this I'll vouch
He's cool, he's no fool

To cure an ennui
You need a bon nuit
It's part of the joie de vie

He's the kind o'cat people hear about
But in a second-handed way
That there's nothing really clear about

Let me introduce you
I've heard that boredom's entered your life
And you're feelin' real low
Have you met Benny Bailey?
Well he's a fella that you should know

They tell me lassitude's has laid you low
An' you're losin' your grip
You must meet Benny Bailey
At least he's somebody who is hip

We're glad you got to meet Benny Bailey
I'm happy fin'lly meeting with you

I can testify that you were really gittin' in it
Much as any person ever could
And you really did it good

But you know his moves are getting stale

That he can't shake her
He can't shake her. 
No, he can't shake her.

Romance falls like rain
But all the motives are insane
Everytime that he plays the game he feels the pain
(He feels the pain. Who is to blame? Who is to blame?)

He finds a joint that's jive
Guys are spinning girls like 45's.
All of the live bait sink for his lines they are so high

He knows he is beat
As his heart puts on the heat
Run from the street that don't even fit his feet

Tell him here's a telephone
He can beg to let the fool come home
He tells her that his life's a drag alone

The Manhattan Transfer,"We sing a spring
(Sing joy spring)
A rare and most mysterious spring
(This most occult thing)
Is buried deep in the soul
(It's story never has been told)

The joy spring, the fountain of pleasure
Is deep inside you whether you're diggin' it or not
Once you're aware of this spring
You'll know that it's the greatest 
Treasure you've got
And furthermore
The joy spring, the bounteous treasure
Cannot be bartered away and never
Can be sold
Nothing can take it from you
It's yours and yours alone to have
And to hold
And something more:
It never is lost to fire or theft
It's always around
When trouble is gone the pleasure
Is left I've always found
It's burglar-proof same as the treasure
Man lays up in heaven worth a
Price no one can measure
That says a lot
So joy spring this fountain of pleasure
That's deep inside you let me inform
You in all truth *(to Coda second time)
Ponce de Leon sought this
When he was searchin' for the fountain of youth

Ol' Ponce de Leon laughed so much he 
Never did find the magic fountain
But many people with a well-adjusted
Spirit they could hear it when why'told
'em it was there tellin' them was
Like tellin' it on the mountain

It's quite a life havin' the gift of 
Laughter I'm a man who knows in a
Minute I can tell why'just exactly how the story goes
It involves a firm conviction in another 
Previous life givin' your mind a chance to fly
Fly aroun' the universe investigatin' other
Galaxies n' certain other subtle
Types o'life tryin' t'dig it gettin'
Pretty well-acquainted with a lot of
Other strife an' pretty much acquirin'
Yourself plenty of education
Pretty soon here comes earth birth
'n then why'ready t'put it all t'work
But soon as you're finished bein' born
You start forgettin' what you knew
'Cause you're another kinda you - a
Reincarnation manifestation
Of spirit in sensation

why'really got that right
The average person isn't bright
Not so bright that they recall the fatal fall
Down here t' this earth
Their minds disguise their death to spirit
Life and call it birth
That's their reason for forgetting and they 
Find it very upsetting when reminded 
Tell 'em they've lived before
They'll show why' the nearest open door
Gotta have feelin' while dealin' with
Walkers in their sleep
They can't imagine somethin' as deep

Here they come - here they come - there they are
Unimaginative and ignorant of falling from a star
Here they come - there they are - there they go
Life is over in a minute an' they never dug
It in it or enjoy a minute of it
'cause they put too much above it
That was gross
Somethin' that was worth a couple bucks
At mos'

So there is the reason that the maker of man
Included there in his plan
A certain fountain deep within'
Where there was laughter, youth 'n gold
For human beings t'have 'n hold
'n share the memory of where we've all been

Brothers called Grimm knew chances were slim'
Anybody would dig that the human soul 
Was Snow White
And the Seven Dwarfs were seven tempers 
In man 
Whose digging out the gold completes 
The plan
An Bacon was hip that Shakespeare 
Couldn't read
And so he gave him all the rhymes
That have lasted through the years
And kept eternal truths alive through
Several centuries
That's how we know them now 
They lasted 'cause they're true

What was it from ""MacBeth?""
""Life's but a walking shadow
A player poor
That struts and frets upon the stage
And's seen no more
A tale that truly has an idiotic ring
That's full of lotsa sound and fury
Signifying nothing...""

That's right signifying nothing
I'll repeat it! Nothing
Don't forget it - Nothing
And that's the reason for that spring 
Of joy
That the Father put inside of every
Single girl and boy

Show time! Everyone's on
Let's hit the stage
It's show time everyone an' proceed 
To act your age

Whatever you're frownin' at is funny
Enough f'laughin'
So you're wastin' all your humor on a frown
While you're bringin' your spirit down

You gotta book yourself a comic in your act
Without some laughter life's a maudlin
Farce 'n that's a fact

Once you know about the spring you always can smile
It becomes your one expression
And you're always wearin' it like the 
Buddhas do

(Repeat Intro to *)
(Coda)

When he was searchin' 
For the fountain of youth
I say in truth he
Sought a magical thing
For he was searchin'

You love her

your passionate pleasures

The Manhattan Transfer,"With a key, you unlock a door to imagination
Beyond it is another dimension
A dimension of sight
A dimension of sound
A dimension of mind

You're moving through a land of both shadow and substance
Of things and ideas
Guiding you through this wondrous journey
Is the hypnotic sound of the twilight tone

When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time, oh oh

Out of nowhere comes this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Pyramidal locomotion
From a mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Hearin' the twilight, twilight tone

Unpretentious girl from Memphis
Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, wo, oh, oh

Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round and 'round
A signpost up ahead is calling
Through the mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
(Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm)
Hearin' the twilight
(Twilight swept away, ba da, loo da, ba da loo da)
Hearin' the twilight, twilight tone

One Mr. Miller, who's about to take a trip
Into oddness and obsolescence
Through a zone whose boundaries are that of imagination
Accompanying him on this journey is the mesmerizing
Sound of the twilight tone

On a cold and rainy night
One Mister Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him play that beat, oh, oh

Suddenly he heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Now, he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone

Yes indeed he was
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
I fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone 
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you 

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone 
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin' 
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins 

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone 
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will 
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country 
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world he is known
Rhythm was his special joy 
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

The Manhattan Transfer,"When traveling abroad in the continental style
It's my belief that one must attempt to be discreet
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position
Allows you a perspective that's unique
Though you'll find your itinerary's a blessing and a curse
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down
And you wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
To stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town
Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
That remains the object of their long relentless quest
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
The pursuit you see and never the arrest

Without fear or contradiction Bon Voyage is often hollered
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore
By a girl that drives a Rambler and furthermore
Is overly concerned that she won't see him anymore
Planes and trains and boats and buses
Characteristically evoke a common attitude of blue
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
And the cargo that they're carrying is you

And domestically approved romantic fancy
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances knowing

Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
Ever since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world of grieve
I need your words of confidence
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless feel confusion
And your love is your solution

It's my fault
And I won't search for you no longer
As I go home alone
Needing you to stop

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
And my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In a helpless situation
And I need your consolation
And I'm having these strange illusions",Helpless,1992

SO YOU SAY (ESQUINAS)
Music by Djavan
Lyrics by Amanda McBroom

So you say
It's a feeling I'll get over someday
So you say
So you say
I should try
Just to let the flame inside me die
I should try
So you say
Against the wind
With my face turned to the empty side
Of loneliness
Midnight black and blue

So you say
That the world will keep on turning
So you say
So you say
Tell me why
All the stars have lost their mystery now
Tell me why
Tell me how
Where love has been
The taste of wine
Seems to linger on like distant perfume
And all of the memories
Carelessly left behind
Ghosts and lies
They haunt me wherever I go

So you say
That the pain of love will pass away
So you say
So you say

(Sax solo)

Before goodbye
I look for the fire behind your eyes 
But they're cold as ice
I hear in your voice
The echo of love that's gone by
Now I cry
I'll love you for all of my life

So you say
It's a feeling I'll get over someday
So you say
So you say

The Manhattan Transfer,"I used to be so fancy free,
But really lonesome as could be,
Till one lucky day, you came my way
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you.

I knew it right from the start
I used to think there'd never be,
A girl who'd ever care for me,
Then, what d'ya know, you made it so, 
I never knew what love was all about,
Until I met you.

Once we start, then we'll never part
In my blue life, 
No one at all would even care if I cried.
(Hurtin' inside)
In my new life,
I'm walkin' tall, I got a feelin' of pride
Glowin' inside.

And, lover, you're the reason why, 
A lonely girl is ridin' high
Now, who do you see, lucky as me?
I never knew what love was all about,
Until I met you.

It's cherry pink -
And apple blossom white
That's right - pink and white
I be tellin' why' right
Who'da' ever believed a guy that 
Hustled pool was such a romantic;
He really was frantic

He pursue'd me 
Chalkin' his cue
Lemme' tell why? now, without a doubt
Gettin' ready for a little romance 
The rustic romeo pursued me 
Now is his chance
He showed me such emotion that I finally 
That's what t'do if he's got some eyes
Took a notion to give in 
F'Hittin on you

An' when why' took the notion
Love is a game
Did you imagine his emotion
Everybody plays it the same
Ever was the kind t' go f'coolin'
It's a game - why' play by the rules

Did 'ja think he might be jivin' and only foolin'
Tho why' know the winners are victims
Or did you appraise it as real?
An' losers are fools

Did you go f'what came?
Now that you're his
Or was love in the game?
He see'n put his mind t'tending t' biz 
If love is the answer 
'Cause that's how it is -
Then you'll never, ever be quite the same 
When why' find love, that's the one thing
I'm sure you know that that's so 
You'll be sure of -

Well I dropped m'heart now an' bent it
Said a few sincere words
Never dreamin' that I meant it
To tell you the truth, I never,
Ever really meant to begin it

How can you explain true love?
How can I disdain true love?
Love is real exciting it's so exciting - That when it
Turned me around I didn't feel like fighting

It wouldn't a caught me
Except when I saw you I was surer than sure
This really couldn't be
But what'why-know
It really was so!
I'm ready f'settlin' right down
No more runnin' around

And that's the truth, really the truth,
Really ain't puttin' on no act.
Really a fact
Really, this ain't no time f'jivin'
'Cause what I'm tellin' why' really comes 
Right from this heart of mine
An' lemme tell why' there's an awful lot o'
Sacrifice t' lay it on the line

What's this thing people call love
Something nobody has too much of
This game all misunderstand, but play it

One thing's sure; Love's what I'm in
Unloose cupid's bow, let it begin
That's it! Let that madness start!
There goes my heart!

It's got me stumblin', it's got me mumblin'
I'm like a ship without a rudder,
A car without wheels
Unless why' feel it, I can't reveal it
Why' gotta have it happen to why'
T' know how it feels

One thing's sure; Love has got me
I'm as certain as certain can be
I'm yours till eternity

From the day that we met
When you showed on the set
I remember it yet
I was knocked out

I took one look at you
And what else could I do
Love walked in and I knew
There was no doubt
No, no doubt

I love you, yes, I sure do, yes, I love you
Yes, you know it
I know that you knew from the start

Now we two become one
And we'll make it together

I never really knew what love was all about
Until I met you.

I never really knew what love was all about
Until I met you.
