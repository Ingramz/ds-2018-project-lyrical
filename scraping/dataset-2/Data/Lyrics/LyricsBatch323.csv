Gotye,"I'm living with your memory
In the attic in my mind
And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
'cause when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know

When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was

And you, you fade
But the memory remains the same
And I, I can't change
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane

You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
'cause your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left




",The Only Thing I Know,2003
Gotye,"You've been gone much longer than you
Ever said you had the plan to
I'm just gonna wait 'till you come home

Though I count the days, they're grey without you
The weather's much better when I think about you
I'm just gonna wait till you come home

Empty glasses, burnt out matches
Curtains drawn on near-full blackness
I'm sleeping through the day, you're coming home
To reclaim this heart you owned

Lover, leave me
Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!

I'll wait patiently for your return
You're coming back!
You're coming back!

I'm clutching at straws
I'm climbing up the walls
But every time I fall
Back into my hole
I'm feeling like a wretch
I'm looking for a catch
But you're an itch that I can't scratch
I know you're coming back

You've been gone so long you're fading
And it takes all the time I can find just retaining
Thoughts of things we did while you were here
But I know you will return my dear",Coming Back,2006
Gotye,"This will teach them how to groove
All right, let's get acquainted (hello there)
Music from the bass perspective

This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will to bring you
New color, new diminution, new values
And a new experience, stereophonic sound

(And now ladies and gentlemen, our feature act tonight)
(Stop!)
(Get it, get it, get it!)

Come on, Come on, Come on

That was the harpsichord
Now-a-days, most homes seem to prefer 
The television or radio, to the harpsichord, 
But you still hear the piano, all the time
A flute couldn't do that

These are some of the difficulties
With being a disposition and talking to you
And just wanting really deeply to relate to you
And touch you, not physically, but with vibration (ha ha ha ha)

Never heard metal sound like that before

The drummer is the heartbeat
Everything comes from him
He is the beat, the time, the heartbeat
It's just like a heart pumping blood 
To the rest of the body
He is the heartbeat of a band, a group
He is the heartbeat

I think around midpoint in my career
I started to experiment with sounds
And then it became very important to
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound

Maybe if I spend more time practicing,
Eventually I can get it together

Um, here's some more music

All right! Here we go!
Now were going to use a little power kicks
Like I showed you before
We're going to chuck-em real good
A-minor to F
Just like all the heavy metal guys use, okay
Lets get some of that smoke just like on MTV
Yeah! all right!

Music, all right
Yeah! all right!
Would you say that again
Yeah! all right!
Let's play a note
Yeah! all right!
Here's some more music
Yeah! all right!

Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound

We've covered a lot of ground, haven't we?
If there's a part of our story you don't understand
Why don't you turn this record over
And start playing over again
Over again
Over again",A Distinctive Sound,2006
Gotye,"Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
Its not enough
You just threw away the key
To your heart

You don't get burned
'Cause nothing gets through
It makes it easier
Easier on you
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see

Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Gotye,"If yer always tryin' to get to the top
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'!
Then you're gone before you know it;
You'd better stop! (Stop!)
Learn a little givin' and lovin'

It's been done before
C'mon, do it again!
Coz if it's good
Then you should share it round
What's the use of keeping
All the good things that you've found to yourself?

Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'

You don't gotta keep no other man down
For you to get up
There's no need to worry
Just don't give away your self-respect
Coz if it's all you've got left
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey!

But give away love (Give it!)
And give it for free
No strings attached
Just don't ask for it back

Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little

I'm comin' round
To pick you up
And take you out

It won't be long
'Till those blues are gone
The city's waiting
Beckoning for us
It leads us on
Let it lead us on

It's the perfect night
To just drive on by
Let the dashboard underscore
Everything we've seen
While the world plays for our pleasure
On our windshield silver screen
And I don't know just where we're going
And I don't care where we've been
But we just coast on through
Cause while I'm here with you, you know
There's no place I'd rather be
No place I'd rather be

Such a quiet joy
Knowing that I'm your pick-up fix
And you're my favourite boy

You're feeling tired
And I'm bleary-eyed
And the highway lines
Pass by in two/four double-time
And we don't even recognize
A single name on the street signs
Nothing else is calling us
But all we've left behind
Is like a hell-hound on our trail
And a burden on our mind
Cause we know
We gotta go home.

Such a quiet joy
Driving anywhere
Knowing that you are there.
But you don't call,
You don't call me no more
And I waited all day
You know you'll always

Is buried in dust,
And this dust is all that's left of us.

Didn't want to fail myself again

Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin

And I could not love
'Cause I could not love myself
Never good enough, no
That was all I'd tell myself
And I was not well
But I could not help myself
I was giving up on living

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared

And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself
And you're patient, love
And you help me help myself
And you save me
And you save me
Yeah you save me",Save Me,2011
Gotye,"You're a fraud and you know it
But it's too good to throw it all away
Anyone would do the same
You've got 'em going
And you're careful not to show it
Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
It's like magic
But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game
Anyone would do the same

So now that you've arrived well you wonder
What is it that you've done to make the grade
And should you do the same?
(Is that too easy?)
Are you only trying to please them
(Will they see then?)
You're desperate to deliver
Anything that could give you
A sense of reassurance
When you look in the mirror

Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show
All these highs and lows
And you're never really sure
What you do it for
Well do you even want to know?
You put on quite a show

Are you watching?

You're a fraud and you know it
And every night and day you take the stage
And it always entertains
You're giving pleasure
And that's admirable, you tell yourself
And so you'd gladly sell yourself
To others

Gotye,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

Gotye,"When the cotillion arrived
We threw out the television
I'm Model D 575
Has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition

Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
That there's an orchestra in the lounge room

I put the genie bass on
So my left hand can play the choir
With sixteen foot Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer

Banjo's great on repeat
The kids want to play but they'll have to be patient
The wife can't help tapping her feet
It's a genuine home entertainment revelation

State, state, state, state of the art
(State of the art)
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art
(Listen to the difference!)
State, state, state, state of the art
(By use of a computer)
(Oh my God, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art

Now we don't want to go out
When we could spend the night at home with the cotillion
Invite the neighbors around
Start the boss a nova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen

Enjoy the state of the art
The magic swing piano really is astounding
Now we can't tell them apart
But these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

State, state, state, state of the art
(State of the art)
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art
(Computer controlled tone color)
State, state, state, state of the art

Gouda Mayhem,"Trucking down by the roadside
Met a man with a starhide
He said boy wouldn't you like to look
But could it give me love
Give me little love from her heart

Bopping down by the whirlpool
I met a girl she was god's tool
I said girl wouldn't you like to rock
But could it give me love
Give me little love from god's heart

Walking down by the westwind
I met a boy he was my friend
I said boy we could sing it too
And we do
Give us love
Give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts

And then we'll walk.

Just tuned my car, now she really peels
A-lookin' real tough with chrome reverse wheels

I'll get my honey, grab some money, split to Drag City

Gourdan Banks,"We all get caught in our own sins
Sometimes I have to remind myself
That on my worst day I live like somebody on their greatest and so do you
Don't let your demons take you to hell, introduce them to heaven

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doing life, they ain't ever coming home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me cause she said I did her wrong
'Cause I left to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listening to me
That back and forth arguing was getting in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part time
I used to play the block early morning and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rapping brought me back to life
'Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strapping like we was in Iraq to fight
'Cause niggas getting murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Woah, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boiling water, in the world of no order
In the hood ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'mma get the fam right, nigga you damn right

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hopping out of shit
Right now I'm praying for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell a difference
My man coming home, my other man getting sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hating on your pictures
We dream chasing, y'all niggas walking behind wishes
Without working for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothing all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a head shot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's see through

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life",Heaven or Hell,2014

Love my yuppie job
Got a cellular phone in my brand new Saab
I love my wife and my girlfriend too
I just love myself 
You're gonna love me too

Came out west to find myself 
Did the Maharishi squat on the continental shelf 
Got a groovy set of morals 
And an Elvis Presley do
I'll swap my wife for yours
Anything for you

Got to stay away from the left coast groovies
Living their lives like a cheesy movie
The wrap around shades and the air-head cuties
Got a new-age stench because he traded his Patchouli

Can the wicked feed the hungry?
Can the children teach the old?
About a new way, a revolution
We're moving backwards, out of control
Out of control, out of control

Came out west to find myself

Talkin' 'bout some low down dirty shame

Where the young boys chase the dragon

And we'll lie awake till sleep overtakes us
Can't you see 
There's no need to suffer anymore

Defenseless, trapped in a cage
Blissfulness devoured by the rage
Fate's been cruel, though the years have been kind
You've go to heal yourself, no need to stay blind

No need to suffer anymore
Wrap yourself in the warmth of my arms

Once bore the skin of your fathers
Guess that means it's out of your hands
Or you're too tired, too tired to bother

Now that your vision is blinded, I guess

And who do I tell, ""I've done nothing wrong'ÃÂ¢??""

Seems like, maybe, you missed your calling

For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by
To carry you away

Target practice with other people's lives
Hit a few right between the eyes

Can't get one moments peace
To save my doggone soul
I've been doing more than drinking'
Trying' to ease my pain
But everywhere I go, somebody speaks your name
All my friends keep on asking'
Boy what's wrong with you
I say I'm worried, worried down with the blues

Tried to be a good man
Worked my fingers to the bone
And you returned the favor
By wreckin' up my happy home
You played so many dirty tricks
'Til I lost my faith in you
Now you want me to take you back
What's a poor man supposed to do

Worried down with the blues
Oh, yes I am
Worried down with the blues
Feel like I was born to lose
I used to walk with pride
With my head held high
Now I'm staring down at my shoes
Yes, I'm worried, worried down with the blues

You made me turn my back
On my very best friends
And when my back was turned
You were messin' around with them
Still I'd give up everything
To have you back by my side
'Cause in the cold, cold night
When I reach for you
All I'm holdin' is my foolish pride

Worried down with the blues
Oh, yes I am
Worried down with the blues
Feel like I was born to lose

Near the Iron River past the old church line
Lives a hot gal, smells of stale wine
We call her greasy granny

She's a slap down, cranked up two ball bitch
She's stone wash denim if she's wearing a stitch
We love our greasy granny

She's cooking up the gravy in a claw foot tub
Waiting in the kitchen you can get a back rub from old greasy granny

Do you ask that you might own

I will make my way alone

Stands above the garden wall

To find his lady gone away
Made haste to follow in her track
Where she could go but not turn back

The blue-eyed hound at her side did bay
While fast her breath did fade away
She cried out, ""Turn, my love, and go
I would not you see me so""

Fare you well and I would not weep
Bid you tend your prayers to keep
Hill by dale now I must go
To the forest of Fennario

But there was a time when her beauty raised the eyebrows of the town

Too heavy to lift, she feels too weak to try

To fill the void where her heart once was
Now she just fills her glass again
And again

And she walks the floor less traveled
Thinks of a sad melody
Wine and blood don't mix like they used to
Now they just make a memory
Too many years trying to do the right thing for the wrong man
Now the picture is clear
She drinks and she cries and she hides from the past
'Cause the truth is more bitter than the tears

All these half-truths and alibis help build a wall of denial
She takes comfort in the night, darkness blocks the light
From falling on her aging smile
Grey befalls her halo where there once was a golden mane
And her eyes don't shine like they used to
Without the moon, the sun would be in vain

So she walks the floor less traveled
Thinks of a sad melody
Wine and blood don't mix like they used to
Now they just make a memory
Too many years trying to the right thing for the wrong man
Now the picture is clear
She drinks and she cries and she hides from the past
'Cause the truth is more bitter than the tears

She puts on h er make-up, though no one's seen her for days
Her silence is a lonely cry
She's trapped inside a maze
Her tears have turned to honey, drawing the black flies of depression
Desiree's in disarray waiting for her angels again",Wine and Blood,2004

But not smart enough to never look back

Innocence in abundance on these lonely streets-but I feel guilty just the same 

Now the words that I have written are ringing in my head 
Oh,and I think I believe them 
A million miles from yesterday and a million more to go 
Still I search each day

There's an age old remedy for a lonely heart

So you blame it on jealousy-you say the rumors are untrue 
But you feel yourself slipping away

You were gonna be a superstar-Elvis was teaching you how 

You met a man in a suit-he said ""Sign on the line 
But you'll need a little something to help you unwind""

You got to ride like Hell-your face into the wind 
One day you're everything-then you're nothing again

Still they got something to say

But somewhere along the way-your poor heart just caved in 

So you smoke a little that and you drink a little this 
And soon you can't separate the misery from the bliss

Anyone can be blinded-caught up in the lust 
But we all must go back-back to our own dust

Many times I've seen her spirit fade away only to rise again 

So weak so strong, there's only one of her in the universe 
Bringing darkness, bringing light, so weak so strong

Smokin' only the best weed
Hangin' out from the so called hippie set

Seen with just the right faces

At the end of a long hard day
I don't want to be another brother

I want to look around me
And cherish everything I see
I want to look behind me 
And know this is my destiny
I want to keep rejoicing

And when my voice is gone
Wanna pick up my guitar and play

Maybe you can recall that feeling now

Foresaken savior, where do we go from here

Do you have your sights set on another journey
Or is it finally time to throw in the towel
Are you scared the world will never sing your praises
Do you bury your head in the sand
Do you step up and take it like a man

If you find your way back to reality
I think you'll find it really hasn't changed that much

Yo if it wasn't for the PJ's y'all probably never heard of me
Y'all be like, ""Who the hell is Wyclef, and what's a Fugee?""
I'd probably be standin on a corner, watch you approach
Steal ya dope, sell ya coke, then snatch ya rope
Run for brokes with the cash and the jewels
Bulls eye, I hold my breath when I shoot
The reason you should hold ya breath; 'cause most thugs
When they breathe and shoot tecs, they aim right but shoot left
Now they flesh being swept off the surface
If you ain't B.I.G. then you ain't Notorious
So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat
Someone bring him a bed, to the permanent sleep
Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath

Before I was signed, I used to move on the grind
All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme
Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line
To prison and take a message to Shyne
Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero
It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow""
Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough
You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal
It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin
""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine
In the projects God, nuttin come easy
Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy
Move like a professional, young thug funeral

Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it

An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]

How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

You spoiled rotten you with the man is allowed you with temp you plotted
Ways to make cream and took the profits elsewhere money grip 
As far as I'm concerned your ass best not slip
Or get hit and injected with the truth to your vein
And a sticker on your face that reads ""GP the grain""
You wonder where this shit in my from recognition (what what what what

You been out for years and ain't a motherfucker mention
Where that shit came from instead you play dumb

In your circumference, quick fast you never saw me comin
Like that gun I'm stunnin, makin niggas run and
The shocker, I cause electrical sparks
Like a flashin light in the dark in the thunderstorm at night
The bark is equivalent to the bite
So test the teeth, nigga feel the grief
Bloodthirsty, observe as I rehearse thee murder plan
White man can't kill like my pen
I'll be damned if I let these niggas approach me
On the East side where my coast be, look closely
Before I snap my fingers and transform to smoke with the quickness
No doubt I'm sick with the slickness
The realness, ten years of dues I can't lose
Paid up, dyin in this bed that I made up
So be out before I spit out the venom
And be my victim so I can live forever in the rhythm

Grace,"If we shall dance we shall dance for the night
I wish for love but sweet love takes her time
Hand on my heartily just to the night
Every star waits for the darkness to shine
Why do I cry when the tears never dry
Why do I drown when I look through your eyes
Love is the morning that succeeds the night
I was gone by the first sign of the light

When it's dark out
I search for love but don't find it
Just sex and drugs but don't mind it
Because nothing's real I'm reminded
And I do suppose
Ignorance is bliss, truth be told
They say go smash these groupie hoes
And spend money on some newer clothes
And put poison up through your nose
Well,
Eventually everything fades
Even the brightest of colors turn greys
Highs comes down but the pain still stays
Even the longest of nights turn days
Then,
Wake up when it's over
Love to escape 'cause I hate being sober
And you and I we never had closure
We just knew when it was over

Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Troubled mind of an artist
But the star comes alive in the darkness
Late nights Lower East side apartments
But the night is impossible to harness
Soon as comes it departs us
Couldn't stay & love you so I became heartless
Lost track of our long term targets
Live and die young leave a beautiful carcass
Thinkin' when we just had met
Realizing now that it just wasn't meant
But how would we know if the time wasn't spent?
If only we could live where the sun doesn't set
Somewhere it's always light out and happy
You and I were like a Sid vicious and Nancy
I mean it was bound to be tragic its
No way this ever could have lasted

Play the same old record
Makes me think of when we first met
So I wait 'til the phone rings
Said you'd call me by the morning
Why you hiding, darling?
What you been up to, I'm bored

I stay up all night, but I need love to keep me kind
I can't do this anymore, who's gon' catch me when I fall?
Why is there love if we born to die?
I need us, keep me high
I can't do this anymore, will you hold me when I'm gone?
Or when you're gone?

Oh when you're gone

I light another Newport cigarette
Take another sip, now you want my lips
Find another way, we gotta switch
I might even leave just to get you pissed
Where is my baby?
I've been waiting for you

Tired of playing games
All I'm trying to say is all you boys are the same
The way I feel has changed
I don't know if I could be yours

Everyone complains
Not anymore
