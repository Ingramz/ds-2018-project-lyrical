Gotye,"I'm living with your memory
In the attic in my mind
And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
'cause when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know

When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was

And you, you fade
But the memory remains the same
And I, I can't change
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane

You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
'cause your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left




",The Only Thing I Know,2003
Gotye,"You've been gone much longer than you
Ever said you had the plan to
I'm just gonna wait 'till you come home

Though I count the days, they're grey without you
The weather's much better when I think about you
I'm just gonna wait till you come home

Empty glasses, burnt out matches
Curtains drawn on near-full blackness
I'm sleeping through the day, you're coming home
To reclaim this heart you owned

Lover, leave me
Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!

I'll wait patiently for your return
You're coming back!
You're coming back!

I'm clutching at straws
I'm climbing up the walls
But every time I fall
Back into my hole
I'm feeling like a wretch
I'm looking for a catch
But you're an itch that I can't scratch
I know you're coming back

You've been gone so long you're fading
And it takes all the time I can find just retaining
Thoughts of things we did while you were here
But I know you will return my dear",Coming Back,2006
Gotye,"This will teach them how to groove
All right, let's get acquainted (hello there)
Music from the bass perspective

This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will to bring you
New color, new diminution, new values
And a new experience, stereophonic sound

(And now ladies and gentlemen, our feature act tonight)
(Stop!)
(Get it, get it, get it!)

Come on, Come on, Come on

That was the harpsichord
Now-a-days, most homes seem to prefer 
The television or radio, to the harpsichord, 
But you still hear the piano, all the time
A flute couldn't do that

These are some of the difficulties
With being a disposition and talking to you
And just wanting really deeply to relate to you
And touch you, not physically, but with vibration (ha ha ha ha)

Never heard metal sound like that before

The drummer is the heartbeat
Everything comes from him
He is the beat, the time, the heartbeat
It's just like a heart pumping blood 
To the rest of the body
He is the heartbeat of a band, a group
He is the heartbeat

I think around midpoint in my career
I started to experiment with sounds
And then it became very important to
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound

Maybe if I spend more time practicing,
Eventually I can get it together

Um, here's some more music

All right! Here we go!
Now were going to use a little power kicks
Like I showed you before
We're going to chuck-em real good
A-minor to F
Just like all the heavy metal guys use, okay
Lets get some of that smoke just like on MTV
Yeah! all right!

Music, all right
Yeah! all right!
Would you say that again
Yeah! all right!
Let's play a note
Yeah! all right!
Here's some more music
Yeah! all right!

Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound

We've covered a lot of ground, haven't we?
If there's a part of our story you don't understand
Why don't you turn this record over
And start playing over again
Over again
Over again",A Distinctive Sound,2006
Gotye,"Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
Its not enough
You just threw away the key
To your heart

You don't get burned
'Cause nothing gets through
It makes it easier
Easier on you
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see

Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

But I'm desperate to connect

Gotye,"If yer always tryin' to get to the top
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'!
Then you're gone before you know it;
You'd better stop! (Stop!)
Learn a little givin' and lovin'

It's been done before
C'mon, do it again!
Coz if it's good
Then you should share it round
What's the use of keeping
All the good things that you've found to yourself?

Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'

You don't gotta keep no other man down
For you to get up
There's no need to worry
Just don't give away your self-respect
Coz if it's all you've got left
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey!

But give away love (Give it!)
And give it for free
No strings attached
Just don't ask for it back

Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and stop!

Gotye,"When you're feeling down
I'm comin' round
To pick you up
And take you out

It won't be long
'Till those blues are gone
The city's waiting
Beckoning for us
It leads us on
Let it lead us on

It's the perfect night
To just drive on by
Let the dashboard underscore
Everything we've seen
While the world plays for our pleasure
On our windshield silver screen
And I don't know just where we're going
And I don't care where we've been
But we just coast on through
Cause while I'm here with you, you know
There's no place I'd rather be
No place I'd rather be

Such a quiet joy
Knowing that I'm your pick-up fix
And you're my favourite boy

You're feeling tired
And I'm bleary-eyed
And the highway lines
Pass by in two/four double-time
And we don't even recognize
A single name on the street signs
Nothing else is calling us
But all we've left behind
Is like a hell-hound on our trail
And a burden on our mind
Cause we know
We gotta go home.

Such a quiet joy
Driving anywhere
Knowing that you are there.
But you don't call,
You don't call me no more
And I waited all day
You know you'll always

Everything we had, everything we did,
Is buried in dust,
And this dust is all that's left of us.

Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin

And I could not love
'Cause I could not love myself
Never good enough, no
That was all I'd tell myself
And I was not well
But I could not help myself
I was giving up on living

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared

And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself
And you're patient, love
And you help me help myself
And you save me
And you save me
Yeah you save me",Save Me,2011
Gotye,"You're a fraud and you know it
But it's too good to throw it all away
Anyone would do the same
You've got 'em going
And you're careful not to show it
Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
It's like magic
But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game
Anyone would do the same

So now that you've arrived well you wonder
What is it that you've done to make the grade
And should you do the same?
(Is that too easy?)
Are you only trying to please them
(Will they see then?)
You're desperate to deliver
Anything that could give you
A sense of reassurance
When you look in the mirror

Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Gotye,"When the cotillion arrived
We threw out the television
I'm Model D 575
Has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition

Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
That there's an orchestra in the lounge room

I put the genie bass on
So my left hand can play the choir
With sixteen foot Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer

Banjo's great on repeat
The kids want to play but they'll have to be patient
The wife can't help tapping her feet
It's a genuine home entertainment revelation

State, state, state, state of the art
(State of the art)
(Hold the phone, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art
(Listen to the difference!)
State, state, state, state of the art
(By use of a computer)
(Oh my God, it's so)
State, state, state, state of the art

Now we don't want to go out
When we could spend the night at home with the cotillion
Invite the neighbors around
Start the boss a nova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen

Enjoy the state of the art
The magic swing piano really is astounding
Now we can't tell them apart
But these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

Met a man with a starhide
He said boy wouldn't you like to look
But could it give me love
Give me little love from her heart

Bopping down by the whirlpool
I met a girl she was god's tool
I said girl wouldn't you like to rock
But could it give me love
Give me little love from god's heart

Walking down by the westwind
I met a boy he was my friend
I said boy we could sing it too
And we do
Give us love
Give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts

And then we'll walk.

Gourdan Banks,"We all get caught in our own sins
Sometimes I have to remind myself
That on my worst day I live like somebody on their greatest and so do you
Don't let your demons take you to hell, introduce them to heaven

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doing life, they ain't ever coming home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me cause she said I did her wrong
'Cause I left to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listening to me
That back and forth arguing was getting in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part time
I used to play the block early morning and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rapping brought me back to life
'Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strapping like we was in Iraq to fight
'Cause niggas getting murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Woah, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boiling water, in the world of no order
In the hood ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'mma get the fam right, nigga you damn right

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hopping out of shit
Right now I'm praying for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell a difference
My man coming home, my other man getting sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hating on your pictures
We dream chasing, y'all niggas walking behind wishes
Without working for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothing all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a head shot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's see through

Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into heaven, some make it into hell

Gov't Mule,"You ask me when I'm gonna return
I ask you ""why so much concern?""
The same snakes that drive you from my bed
Turn to voices and drive me out of my head
For fourteen days since you been back around
Trying to keep my spirits high and my demons down
But, can't you see
You got to save me or set me free

'cause I'm falling in deeper, darkness, my old friend
I'm in deeper, stay with me till the end
Deeper, you know I got no restraint
I'm in deeper 
And lucky you
You get to be my saint
Temporary saint

Cleaning up one more time is sure getting old
Why don't you bury me like the dirt that's in my soul
What makes you think you could love me, anyway?
Ain't nobody told you about the way I operate
Ain't nobody told you, baby?
Well, I guess that makes you the only one

'cause I'm falling in deeper, darkness, my old friend
I'm in deeper, stay with me till the end
Deeper, you know I got no restraint
I'm in deeper 
And lucky you, yeah, lucky you
You get to be my saint
Temporary saint

Angel of mercy, set me free
Do you really give a damn for me?

Is to be one up on your brother
Like a blind man in the dark

Face to face we will meet again
But never eye to eye
Meanwhile, in your mania
Your four wings touch the sky
Fly too high the wax will melt
And you'll fall down to your knees

Is that you ask nothing from me

To do what the men couldn't do

Split the whole damn town in two
Into the night full of shadows

Reminds us that the bell still tolls

Tigers on T.V.

Heard they had to drag you off the sand
Find a dune and the wind will miss you

Do you ask that you might own

I will make my way alone

To find his lady gone away
Made haste to follow in her track
Where she could go but not turn back

The blue-eyed hound at her side did bay
While fast her breath did fade away
She cried out, ""Turn, my love, and go
I would not you see me so""

Fare you well and I would not weep
Bid you tend your prayers to keep
Hill by dale now I must go
To the forest of Fennario

Gov't Mule,"As I stand here searching for the right words 
I know that wisdom comes from despair 
And I realize it's harder to find your own voice

I wonder just when we stopped being young 
And I know my greatest deeds will go unnoticed 
And our treasures were here all along

Please don't tell me that it's overdue 
And from the four corners of the universe

And a taste no other shall ever know 
That upon my tongue shall remain

Hold me close to your breast 
Dress my wounds with your innocence 
I am weary let me rest 

Let your rain wash over me 
You know all I ever hoped to be 
Is half of what you are to me 

So take me from this island 
Lead me to the mountains of the moon 
As long as you lead I will follow

The circus came to town, I guess it must have stayed 
It's like an endless parade 

All these people you can see through like ghosts, maybe you've seen too much

Strangers stare in silence, they think they know your mind 
No place to jump off, that's the way the game's designed 

Another new day dawns, another sunset fades 
It's like an endless parade 

Music, music and more music imploding inside your brain 
The life that you have chosen did it finally drive you insane 

Psychopathic tirades fill your head with ammunition 
Sights set on your enemies but you keep losing your position 

Reluctantly you face the day try to get your gameface on 
What used to be a fantasy has now become a marathon 

Every heart you ever broke, all the people you've betrayed

And those who peddle it sold their own souls long ago 
They would not know the difference between Vin Diesel and Van Gogh 
They stare at me with envy with their big green bugging eyes 
Spreading filth, buzzing all around my head 
Like flies

Smart enough to say good-bye to this lonely town 
But not smart enough to never look back 

Night falls early on these lonely streets-and time rolls by like a midnight train 
Innocence in abundance on these lonely streets-but I feel guilty just the same 

Now the words that I have written are ringing in my head 
Oh,and I think I believe them 
A million miles from yesterday and a million more to go 
Still I search each day 
Trying to find my way home 

Dreams die young in a lonely heart-and the past seems to follow close behind 
There's an age old remedy for a lonely heart 
But there's no peace in this soul of mine

So you blame it on jealousy-you say the rumors are untrue 
But you feel yourself slipping away

You were gonna be a superstar-Elvis was teaching you how 

You met a man in a suit-he said ""Sign on the line 
But you'll need a little something to help you unwind"" 

[Chorus]
You got to ride like Hell-your face into the wind 
One day you're everything-then you're nothing again 

We all know that the journey means more than where you wind up 
But they don't know what it's like to drink from your cup 
Still they got something to say 

You met a girl on the highway-she made you feel like a man 
But somewhere along the way-your poor heart just caved in 

So you smoke a little that and you drink a little this 
And soon you can't separate the misery from the bliss 

[Chorus]

Anyone can be blinded-caught up in the lust 
But we all must go back-back to our own dust 
Back to yesterday 

One cold night in the sixties-in a small town serene 
A young boy sits and stares at a black and white screen 

He's caught up in the rhythm,the words,and the sound 
And it feels just like a ticket out of this town

Men have died from half the pain she endures everyday 
Many times I've seen her spirit fade away only to rise again 

So weak so strong, there's only one of her in the universe 
Bringing darkness, bringing light, so weak so strong 

Men have died from half the pain she endures everyday 
Many times I've seen her spirit fade away only to rise again

Unring the bell, it's time, it's time 
Take back what we had, it's yours and mine 

Shadows of evil cast like giants on the wall 
Do you even know how many people you appall 
And where are all those people on whose backs you climbed 
Too busy saving their own skin and their own kind 

Unring the bell, it's time, it's time

What is hip? If you're really hip, the passing years will show
Into a hip trip, maybe hipper than hip
But what is hip?

You became a part of a new breed
Smokin' only the best weed
Hangin' out from the so called hippie set

And seen in all the right places
Seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied but it ain't quite right

What is hip? Tell me, tell me, if you think you know

Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't

In an effort to find you a new you
Maybe even manage to raise your conscious level

While you're striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
What's hip today, might become passe'

What is hip? Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip? If you're really hip, the passing years will show

Bleeding softly on your floor

It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,

Gov't Mule,"Breathe, breathe in the air.
Don't be afraid to care.
Leave but don't leave me.
Look around and choose your own ground.

Long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be.

Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.

I'll need some information first.
Just the basic facts.
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feeling once again

This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.

Out of the corner of my eye.

Just wait a while for the right day.
And as I rise above the tree lines and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you've said today.
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling.
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round
Frowning.
And who's the fool who wears the crown?

You shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes,
Like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught on the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome
With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!","Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Pts. 1-5",2014
Gov't Mule,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

Your heros for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.

Now they flesh being swept off the surface
If you ain't B.I.G. then you ain't Notorious
So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat
Someone bring him a bed, to the permanent sleep
Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath
Don't matter if you use a desert eagle as your armor
Blood splatter, glass shatter through the project slums
Another one in the obituary column son

(PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's
So I gotta rep for the PJ's
The elevators with the pissy hallways
Bangin on the project walls, all day

(PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's
Wrote my first rhyme in the PJ's
You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's
The PJ's! PJ's

Before I was signed, I used to move on the grind
All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme
Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line
To prison and take a message to Shyne
Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero
It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow""
Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough
You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal
It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin
""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine
In the projects God, nuttin come easy
Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy
Move like a professional, young thug funeral
What ya thought this was another Pepsi commercial?
Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it
Wyclef the president, the PJ's elected him

(PJ's!) I was born in the PJ's
So I gotta rep for the PJ's
The elevators with the pissy hallways
Bangin on the project walls, all day

(PJ's) I gotta make noise for the PJ's
Wrote my first rhyme in the PJ's
You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's
The PJ's! PJ's

Yeah, and to the teachers that said I wouldn't live
And my remains would be found under the Verizano Bridge
Well I'm alive teach! So put ya theory to rest
I ain't Makaveli but I might fake my death
Make no mistake, I'm a hip-hop artist
Before the diamond in the Billboard, the hood charted it
Surburbia bought it, we bootlegged it, we couldn't afford it
'Cause in the PJ's we undergroudn like black markets
The 'P' stand for public housing
The 'R' is for respect that ya get, when ya hold down ya set
The 'O's for ounces that we flip into keys
The 'J's for the judgement handed by the ju-ry
The 'E' is for enter, at your own risk
You know the 'C' that's for the cats that's out to get rich
And the 'T'  trust no one
And the 'S' is for the snitches, you know the outcome

So I gotta rep for the PJ's

An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]

True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry

How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I drug him to my lab, grabbed the pen and the pad
wasn't sure he would make it, these MCs fucked him up bad
fed him guns and drugs, laced him up in gear worn by so-called thugs
had him hanging out in fucked up clubs
he lost his glow, only 17 addicted to blow

his man rap started fucking with r&b
left a nigga low, he talking bout ""I'm strictly in it for the money""

(I don't know) Runnin' through my projects pickin' fresh cotton
Silly of you to think that GP would be forgotten
You spoiled rotten you with the man is allowed you with temp you plotted
Ways to make cream and took the profits elsewhere money grip 
As far as I'm concerned your ass best not slip
Or get hit and injected with the truth to your vein
And a sticker on your face that reads ""GP the grain""
You wonder where this shit in my from recognition (what what what what
what)
You been out for years and ain't a motherfucker mention
Where that shit came from instead you play dumb
Stapleton invented you you ain't know son?
A hundred grand for the head of thee imposter
Description of his face hangin' on the roster
Bring out the lie detector cause we beez the truth injector
You better watch what you say in my Beretta
Will be used for the first time straight out the box

You're a stink bomb I'm comin' Stapleton style
To blow up your whole profile
My shiggy shiggy Shaolin style is so rugged
MC's that like our identity try to dub it
It can't be duplicated the way I situate it
It's too complicated I get highly modivated
It comes to battlin' MCs they start thinkin'
I wonder the fuck Pop with the blood clot drinkin'
I hope it wasn't gas cause I'm about to get up in that ass
You fucked with me first but I should of been the last

You gettin' more record sales than me 
Chances are slim like tryin' to get a job on Wall Street with a diploma
High school graduate just wasn't me 
So '93 be the year I sign up for my G.E.D.
Takin' trades so I have something to fall back on
So on a job interview this looks good
Just in case our records don't sell, knock on wood
My fault but that's just a wild and crazy thought

Cause GP the grain is just so so hot

Just sex and drugs but don't mind it

And I do suppose
Ignorance is bliss, truth be told
They say go smash these groupie hoes
And spend money on some newer clothes
And put poison up through your nose
Well,
Eventually everything fades
Even the brightest of colors turn greys
Highs comes down but the pain still stays
Even the longest of nights turn days

Wake up when it's over

Live and die young leave a beautiful carcass

I ain't an angel, not a nun, and no you ain't no bishop
Bad girls gon' need forgiving
Take a look at you and how you livin'
She smokin' loud, that's why she never listens
And she don't love you, she love your ambition
And when you break up that's an intermission
Now, now, now, now you got your old bool back
Everything's the same, yeah we all go through that
Kimmy she don't eat, she wanna be a model
Either that or maybe win the lotto
When she ain't make it she pick up the bottle
Crash course, she goin' full throttle
When you're lost it's best to look but love it
We got, we got, we got nothin', at least we got each other
And we ain't never gonna lose that
Everything's the same, yeah we all go through that

Sometimes I hate me
Let's play a game, play a game that I like
Say a thing, say a thing, and I might
Look dumb, I'm selfish, you're right
I can't be normal, I lied
Insane, we're gone and I tried
In the attic, been up here all night
I'm lame, so what?

Your bedtime stares, yeah
Oh, your lips would glisten (they did)
