Jackie Trent,"What do I really hear 
What is in the ear of my mind 
Which sounds are true and clear 
And which will never be defined 
The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear 
Are still inside my head 
The kindest words I'll ever know 
Are waiting to be said 
The most and entrancing side of all [should be sight, not side]
Is yet for me to see 
And the dearest love in all the world 
Is waiting somewhere for me 
Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me ",The Sweetest Sounds,2000
Jackie Trent,"I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day",Got to Get You into My Life,2001
Jackie Trent,"You know I've been wanting you
My whole life through
And now that I'm your guy
I'm gonna live and die for only you
Baby, baby now you're gonna know
All the ways I plan to thrill you so
You gonna see
I've saved all the love in me
Just for

You baby,
You baby
You baby
Only you

Wait this long
Wanting your kiss

Jackie Trent,"Come on baby let's tell all the people
We found a way to hem the blues
Let's get together and just start a rumour
That everyone will think is news

Love is warm, love is fine
Love is yours, love is mine
Love is free, love is true
Love is me, love is you

Come on baby let's tell all the people
That love is such a wonderful thing
Let's get together and just start a notion
That everybody else can sing

Come on baby let's tell all the people
That love will never pass you by
Let's get together and just start a habit
That everybody else can try

Come on baby let's tell everybody
That love is still the greatest yet
Let's get together and just start a gimmick
That nobody else can forget

Jackie Trent,"My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh.
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky.
My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

Something happended to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind no matter what I do
And everyday it seems that I want you more

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh.
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky.
My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love
Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me
Once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
For now I have to tell you everyday 

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love
My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh

That can ever change my love",My Love,2003
Jackie Trent,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2006
Jackie Trent,"Everything has its season 
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)
Oh, I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky",Corner of the Sky,2006

Everybody come out

Jackie Trent,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember",Goin' Back,2006

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it queer?

in my career?

So lucky to be loving you

Jackie Trent,"In the chilly hours and minutes
Of uncertainty
I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind

To feel you all around me
And to take your hand
Along the sand
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while
Behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing
T'would make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind

And long to be

Jackie Ward,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Jackie Washington,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

And you sit alone with your thought,
While the chimes ring out with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brought,
Do you think what the end of a perfect day
Can mean to a tired heart,
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray,
And the dear friends have to part?

Well, this is the end of a perfect day,
Near the end of a journey, too;
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong,
With a wish that is kind and true.
For memory has painted this perfect day
With colors that never fade,
And we find at the end of a perfect day
The soul of a friend we've made.",A Perfect Day,1962

Shining in the the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,

O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

Comfort and joy,

Jackie Wilson,"It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heav'n all gracious 
King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hast'ning on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels 
sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings 
unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1998

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

And did it my way!",My Way,1998

Jackie Wilson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'N' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'N' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'N' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,1999

Jackie Wilson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'N' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'N' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'N' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Bille Joe,2006

Yo, yo, yo, hey yo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back
After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back
That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like
""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back
That could never happen, I'm sorry
No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny
Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks
Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight
And when you told me your Merlo, need more grapes
I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!""
And if you did, that's not how you act at all
And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore

Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you
When three was a crowd, but I dealt with it
And your sex wasn't wild, but I dealt with it
I always felt shitted, you should of take me back
The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks
I got you in South connects, for the hard grind
That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time
You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things
And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings
I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do
I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two
I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two
Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on
Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog
Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O
Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat
What you actin' for? Get back in the door
Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on

Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you
Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume
Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle
Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals
We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal
The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you
Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you
Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you

Take me please, take me with ease
Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees
'Member the first time you made my key
You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd

For making a break with your cutting rake
Letting it drip into a pool

Although I know it's lonely down there
Break the chain, break up, break out

Seduced him, reduced him, appealed to the man
With vivid colored fliers and bright arm bands

They will meet them in the trenches but they won't meet eye to eye
Looking down the barrels the opposition will cry
There's hatred in the morning, blood flows in the day
They will all return home and the skies will give way for

Rain, it flows down
Cleansing, freedom, children
Rain

There's disdain, propane, powder and shot
Racism runs free but love is left to rot
There's a mad house, a play house, a place for the old
Got a place for the hungry and a place for the cold
I'm diving, I'm sinking down into the sea
It will rise up to heaven and come back down on me as

Yes, rain, it flows down
Cleansing, freedom, children
Rain

She walks into the garage, pulls the door to the ground
Eases behind the wheel and she puts the seat down
Ignition, submissions, salute, it's time to send
Her poor grieving parents will never see her again

It's late night, there's pistols, there's daggers and drugs
I'll kill nine, I'll take mine, no police, no mugs
It's Greenwich, it's Dallas, it's Beverly Hills
Blood lives taken for sweet, short thrills

Rain, it flows down
Cleansing, freedom, children
Rain

There's disdain, propane, powder and shot
Racism runs free but love is left to rot
There's a mad house, a play house, a place for the old
Got a place for the hungry and a place for the cold

I'm diving, I'm sinking down into the sea
It will rise up to heaven and come back down on me as

Jackopierce,"It's six o'clock now in the morning
As I wait for my train to come
To take me somewhere just outside of Boston
As I run to find the other sun

I'm leaving more behind than I care to talk about
Just more pain than this heart and hands can use
As this big world's always spinning
All that I thought I was winning
I never thought I'd lose

This great force it takes me to the ferry
To cross wind and water so untame
I'm on that ship my life just seems so very small
In comparison to everything around

But there's a girl over there, she's got mahogany hair
And her eyes of sweet amethyst
I bow as she curtsies
It doesn't look like she's going to hurt me
So I decide to add her to my list
And she said

Stay on the Vineyard for the summer
Stay on the Vineyard for the year
We'll find a little youse down there in Oak Bluffs
And our children is all that we'll hear

It seems now that I should be going
As that one day turned into five or six
Although I'm loving all the beautiful things she's
Showing, I back up and I'm enveloped by the mist

I think that maybe it would be better 
If I just wrote her a letter
But instead she grabs me and we kiss",Vineyard,1993
Jackopierce,"In the morning she is waking
With the gold dust in her hair
She is beauty, oh slightly broken
But I love her laying there

Spanish lady, treat her kindly
Feel her warm tenderness
Like Arkansas skies on the Fourth of July
She is painted on the night

And I'm free, free
Free, thank God I'm free

In the morning she is waking
With the gold dust in her hair
She is beauty, oh for just a token
But I can't evade her morning stare

And I'm free, free
Free, thank God I'm free

Won't you please walk down to edit time with me?
And I'm free",Free,1994
Jackopierce,"My baby don't love me anymore
She's tallied up the tickets and
She's laid out the score

My baby don't love me anymore
I used to come in the front entrance
Now I'm getting kicked out the back door

It seemed my summer was going fine
I was drinking dirty water but it tasted like good red wine
While the minutes and hours turned into days
But I found my hopes and principles
Wrapped up in an insecure tight haze

My baby don't love me anymore
She's tallied up the tickets and
She's laid out the score

My baby don't love me anymore
What used to be good loving
Turned into just another chore

And I find myself seeking shade
From the glow of insecurity but it still seemed to pervade
It seemed my lifetime had gone away now it seems that unsatisfactory
Is a place I'm gonna stay because my baby don't love me no more

And I've tried to see far in her mind
That she's my final glory day but maybe her decision
Matched with my disposition doesn't seem that she's no more
Comin' my way

'Cause my baby don't love me no more
She's tallied up the tickets and
She's laid out the score

My baby don't love me no more
What seemed like a string of nice notes
Turned into just an evil chord.

My baby don't love me no more
My baby don't love me no more
My baby don't love me no more

All the pages in your factory

But too slow to come between us

Leaves grow green on trees outside
As the years pass by I want to hide
Far away for you and I to see

And the circle's runnin' round
Like the waves move up and down
Far away for you and I to see
Far away, far away in dark shadows behind tall trees

And our cycles stand in disarray
Like the fragments of a broken chain
Far away for you and I to see
Far away, far away in dark shadows behind tall trees

What was the name she gave herself?
They called her September.
She wasn't known for much except
Her legs and her temper.
He had enough money to get a date back in his place
She kept the lights low to avoid his face
He grabbed her arm a little too hard
He was rough when she pulled away
She started running for the stairs
He thought it was all a game
She'd rather die than be abused again
She broke his grip high now on adrenaline

She pulled a pistol from her purse,
Screamed the party was over.
Not the brightest man in the world
He reached for the revolver
She cocked the handle back and put one into his chest
And watched him fall down the stairs to his final rest
She thought it best,
She turned off all the lights and stereo
She sat in the morning breeze and watched the sun glow on the city below
She sang, ""La-la-la....""

Guess who stepped in the room?
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K
'Telligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate
Tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green

The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on

Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers

Puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'

Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy
Hit y'all with their ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddammit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old-school on this track, I feel invincible

When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals

The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what

Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually

An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you

Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk

I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning

The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

Well I have come to these hills

He was here the other day
But he only came to say
That he was leaving
Did you see his lady
She was looking where he'd gone
But she wasn't letting on
That she was grieving

She's bound to go
Perhaps she'll find him waiting
For his boat in some city far away
She's bound to go

Lately I remember
Afternoons of smoke and wine
There was nothing we could find
But peace and pleasure
And with a smile he told me
That he wanted just to be on his way
Across the sea no man can measure

He won't be back
And the sun may find him sleeping
In the dust of some ruin far away
He won't be back

Early today as I watched while
The skyline was shaking
I heard a rumbling
Early today the mechanical city was waking
And I ran out stumbling, mumbling
Out through the laughter
Of children and dogs

Did you see our brother
He was here the other day
But he only came to say that
He can't breathe here
Did you see his lady
She was reaching for his hand
Just as if to tell her man
That she can't either

They're bound to go
And the sun may find me running after them
Seeing something far away
We won't be back",From Silver Lake,1972
Jackson Browne,"Jamaica was the lovely one
I played her well
As we lay in the tall grass
Where the shadows fell
Hiding from the children
So they would not tell
We would stay there
'Til her sister rang
The evening bell

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These empty hours
Say you will
Come again tomorrow

The daughter of a captain
On the rolling seas
She would stare across
The water from the trees
Last time he was home
He held her on his knees
And said, the next time
They would sail away
Just where they pleased

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These lifeless sails
And stay until
My ships can find the sea

Jamaica was a sweet young one
I loved her true
She was a comfort
And a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together
Next thing I knew
We had brought her things
Down to the bay, what could I do

Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill
These sails
And we will sail until
Our waters have run dry",Jamaica Say You Will,1972
Jackson Browne,"A lady stands before an open window
Staring so far away
She can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching her restless day

She turns from her window to me
Sad smile her apology
Sad eyes reaching to the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still she spares me the word goodbye
And sits alone beside me fighting her feelings
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The sound of the words to speak her troubled mind
So I'm offering these to her as if to be kind
There's a train everyday leaving either way
There's a world, you know
There's a way to go
And you'll soon be gone, that's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawings left there on the table
And a woman's silk lying on the floor
And I would keep them here if I were able
Lock her safe behind this open door

But suddenly it's so clear to me
That I'd asked her to see what she may never see
And now my kind words find their way back to me
There's a train everyday leaving either way
There's a world, you know
You got a way's to go
And I'll soon believe, it's just as well
This is my opening farewell",My Opening Farewell,1972
Jackson Browne,"The papers lie there helplessly
In a pile outside the door
I've tried and tried
But I just can't remember what they're for
The world outside is tugging
Like a beggar at my sleeve
Oh, that's much too old a story to believe

And you know that it's taken its share of me
Even though you take such good care of me
Now you say Morocco and that makes me smile
I haven't seen Morocco in a long, long while
The dreams are rolling down
Across the places in my mind
And I've just had a taste of something fine

The future hides and the past just slides
England lies between
Floating in a silver mist so cold and so clean
California's shaking like an angry child will
Who has asked for love and is unanswered still

And you know that I'm looking back carefully
'Cause I know that there's still
Something there for me
But you said Morocco and you made me smile
And it hasn't been that easy for a long, long while
And looking back into your eyes
I saw them really shine
Giving me a taste of something fine
Something fine

Now if you see Morocco I know you'll go in style
I may not see Morocco for a little while
But while you're there I was hoping
You might keep it in your mind
To save me just a taste of something fine",Something Fine,1972
Jackson Browne,"Though Adam was a friend of mine
I did not know him well
He was alone into his distance
He was deep into his well
I could guess what he was laughing at
But I couldn't really tell
Now the story's told that Adam jumped
But I've been thinking that he fell

Together we went traveling
As we received the call
His destination India
And I had none at all
Well, I still remember laughing
With our backs against the wall
So free of fear, we never thought
That one of us might fall

I sit before my only candle
But it's so little light to find my way
Now this story unfolds before my candle
Which is shorter every hour
As it reaches for the day
But I feel just like a candle in the way
I guess I'll get there
But I wouldn't say for sure

When we parted we were laughing still
As our goodbyes were said
And I never heard from him again
As each our lives we led
Except for once in someone else's
Letter that I read
Until I heard the sudden word
That a friend of mine was dead

I sit before my only candle
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way
Now this journey appears before my candle
As a song that's growing fainter
The harder I play
That I fear before I end I'll fade away
But I guess I'll get there
Though I wouldn't say for sure

Though Adam was a friend of mine,
I did not know him long
And when I stood myself beside him,
I never though I was as strong
Still it seems he stopped his singing
In the middle of his song
Well I'm not the one to say I know
But I'm hoping he was wrong

I'm holding out my only candle
Though it's so little light to find my way
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle
And it's shorter every hour
As it reaches for the day
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way
I hope I'll get there
But I never pray",Song for Adam,1972
Jackson Browne,"Warm and lovely mystery
Fire smiling through
Before this moment fades away
I want to know you
I've got lightening in my pocket
Thunder in my shoe
Have no fear I've got something here
I want to show you

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

It's a low road, a high wire
Going from me to you
And in your eyes
The distance left is closing
I've got a feeling in my oceans
Blood underneath my skin
That into your bright fields
This prison is opening

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

Our shadows wake each day
Though they don't know why
They hope and try, live and die
So leave them in their frozen world
Come and be my lover
If only for one stolen moment
We will live forever
Forever

Warm and lovely mystery
Can you hear the choir
Voices can no longer hold my desire
Just abandon your sad history
And meet me in the fire
Our angels wait
To take us higher and higher
Higher and higher

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie
While I bring it to you

Higher and higher",Under the Falling Sky,1972
Jackson Browne,"Everybody I talk to is ready to leave
With the light of the morning
They've seen the end coming down
Long enough to believe
That they've heard their last warning
Standing alone
Each has his own ticket in his hand
And as the evening descends
I sit thinking 'bout Everyman

Seems like I've always been
Looking for some other place
To get it together
Where with a few of my friends
I could give up the race
And maybe find something better
But all my fine dreams
Well though out schemes
To gain the motherland
Have all eventually come down
To waiting for Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand
Waiting here for Everyman
Don't ask me if he'll show, baby I don't know

Make it on your own if you think you can
Somewhere later on you'll have to take a stand
Then you're going to need a hand

Everybody's just waiting to hear from the one
Who can give them the answers
And lead them back to that place
In the warmth of the sun
Where sweet childhood still dances
Who'll come along
And hold out that strong
That gentle father's hand
Long ago I heard someone say
Something 'bout Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own
Make it  if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand

I'm not trying to tell you
That I've seen the plan
Turn and walk away if you think I am
But don't think too badly
Of one who's left holding sand
He's just another dreamer
Dreaming 'bout Everyman",For Everyman,1973
Jackson Browne,"Colors of the sun 
Flashing on the water top 
Echo on the land 

Picking for a coin 
Many other tiny worlds 
Singing past my hand 

Awake to understand you are not dreaming 
It is not seaming just to be this way 
Dying men draw numbers in the air 
Dream to conquer little bits of time 
Scuffle with the crowd to get their share 
And fall behind their little bits of time 

Voices in the air 
Sympathetic harmony 
Coming from the trees 

Hanging at my door 
Many shiny surfaces 
Clinging in the breeze 

Oh, leave me where I am I am not losing 
If I am choosing not to plan my life 
Disillusioned savior search the sky 
Wanting to just to show someone the way 
Asking all the people passing by 
Doesn't anybody want the way 

I say goodbye to Joseph and Maria 
They think I see another sky 
And from my fallen window I still see them 
I'll never free them from the sky",Colors of the Sun,1973
Jackson Browne,"It is a dance we do in silence 
Far below this morning sun 
You in your life, me in mine 
We have begun 
Here we stand and without speaking 
Draw the water from the well 
And stare beyond the plains 
To where the mountains lie so still 

But it's a long way that I have come 
Across the sand to find this peace 
Among your people in the sun 
Where the families work the land 
As they have always done 
Oh it's so far the other way 
My country's gone 

Across my home has grown the shadow 
Of a cruel and senseless hand 
Though in some strong hearts 
The love and truth remain 
And it has taken me this distance 
And a woman's smile to learn 
That my heart remains among them 
And to them I must return 

But it's a long way that I have come 
Across the sand to find you here 
Among these people in the sun 
Where your children will be born 
You'll watch them as they run 
Oh it's so far the other way 
My life has gone 

If you look for me, Maria 
You will find me in the shade 
Wide awake or in a dream 
It's hard to tell
If you come to me, Maria 
I will show you what I've made 
It's a picture for our lady of the well",Our Lady of the Well,1973
Jackson Browne,"In the time we've known
That we each are a part of one another
We've lost as much as we have won
And as our lives have grown
We have found that it only brings us pain
To hang on to the things that we have done
Still I love the times you've come

When you went away
Taking all that I'd built my false road on
I dropped my life and couldn't find the pieces
Now you come and go
And it's hard but I feel my strength returning
We'll see how far this new road reaches
We'll see a little more each time we come

Now everybody's gonna tell you it's not worth it
Everybody's gotta show you their own thing
You might try to find your way up around it
But the need for love will still remain

Now we're lying here
So safe in the ruins of our pleasures
Laughter marks the place where we have fallen
And our lives are near
So it wouldn't occur to us to wonder
Is this the past or the future that is calling

You know I've loved these times you've come.",The Times You've Come,1973
Jackson Browne,"Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams

People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry",Doctor My Eyes,1973
Jackson Browne,"Some of them were dreamers
And some of them were fools
Who were making plans and thinking of the future
With the energy of the innocent
They were gathering the tools
They would need to make their journey back to nature
While the sand slipped through the opening
And their hands reached for the golden ring
With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge
In the troubled years that came before the deluge

Some of them knew pleasure
And some of them knew pain
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
They went flying around in the rain
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered
And in the end they traded their tired wings
For the resignation that living brings
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
For the glitter and the rouge
And in a moment they were swept before the deluge

Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky

Some of them were angry
At the way the earth was abused
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
And they struggled to protect her from them
Only to be confused
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
In the naked dawn only a few survived
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge

Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky",Before the Deluge,1974
Jackson Browne,"In my early years i hid my tears
And passed my days alone
Adrift on an ocean of loneliness
My dreams like nets were thrown
To catch the love that I'd heard of
In books and films and songs
Now there's a world of illusion and fantasy
In the place where the real world belongs

Still i look for the beauty in songs
To fill my head and lead me on
Though my dreams have come up torn and empty
As many times as love has come and gone

To those gentle ones my memory runs
To the laughter we shared at the meals
I filled their kitchens and living rooms
With my schemes and my broken wheels
It was never clear how far or near
The gates to my citadel lay
They were cutting from stone some dreams of their own
But they listened to mine anyway

I'm not sure what i'm trying to say
It could be i've lost my way
Though i keep a watch over the distance
Heaven's no closer than it was yesterday

And the angels are older
They know not to wait up for the sun
They look over my shoulder
At the maps and the drawings of the journey I've begun

Now the distance leads me farther on
Though the reasons i once had are gone
I keep thinking I'll find what I'm looking for
In the sand beneath the dawn

But the angels are older
They can see that the sun's setting fast
They look over my shoulder
At the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past
And they lay down behind me
To sleep beside the road till the morning has come
Where they know they will find me
With my maps and my faith in the distance
Moving farther on",Farther On,1974
Jackson Browne,"Keep a fire burning in your eye
Pay attention to the open sky
You never know what will be coming down
I don't remember losing track of you
You were always dancing in and out of view
I must've always thought you'd be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now you're nowhere to be found

I don't know what happens when people die
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
It's like a song playing right in my ear
That I can't sing
I can't help listening

I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round
Crying as they ease you down
Cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
(Right on dancing)
No matter what fate chooses to play
(There's nothing you can do about it anyway)

Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone

Keep a fire for the human race
And let your prayers go drifting into space
You never know will be coming down

Perhaps a better world is drawing near
And just as easily, it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
(The world keeps turning around and around)
Go on and make a joyful sound

Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive and the time you go
May lie a reason you were alive but you'll never know",For a Dancer,1974
Jackson Browne,"Looking through some photographs I found inside a drawer
I was taken by a photograph of you
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more
But they didn't show your spirit quite as true

You were turning 'round to see who was behind you
And I took your childish laughter by surprise
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes

Now the things that I remember seem so distant and so small
Though it hasn't really been that long a time
What I was seeing wasn't what was happening at all
Although for a while, our path did seem to climb
When you see through love's illusions, there lies the danger
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life
Like a fountain from a pool

Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to hide sometimes, but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight

Now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams
But that magic feeling never seems to last
And while the future's there for anyone to change, still you know it seems
It would be easier sometimes to change the past
I'm just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you
In my lessons at love's pain and heartache school
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you
There's this loneliness springing up from your life
Like a fountain from a pool

Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight

You've had to hide sometimes but now you're all right
And it's good to see your smiling face tonight

Fountain of sorrow, fountain of light
You've known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight
You've had to struggle, you've had to fight
To keep understanding and compassion in sight
You could be laughing at me, you've got the right
But you go on smiling so clear and so bright",Fountain of Sorrow,1974
Jackson Browne,"Everyone I've ever known has wished me well
Anyway that's how it seems, it's hard to tell
Maybe people only ask you how you're doing
'Cause that's easier than letting on how little they could care
But when you know that you've got a real friend somewhere
Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear

Now to see things clear it's hard enough I know
While you're waiting for reality to show
Without dreaming of the perfect love
And holding it so far above
That if you stumbled onto someone real, you'd never know
(You'd never know)
You could be with somebody who is lonely too
(Sometimes it doesn't show)
He might be trying to get across to you
(Words can be so slow)
When your own emptiness is all that's getting through
There comes a point when you're not sure why you're still talking
I passed that point long ago
(Long ago)
Now I'm so tired of all this circling
And all these glimpses of the end
(You know it's useless to pretend)
That's all the voices say:


Click to learn more...
""You'll go right on circling
Until you've found some kind of friend""

I saw you through the laughter and the noise
You were talking with the soldiers and the boys
While they scuffled for your weary smiles
I thought of all the empty miles
And the years that I've spent looking for your eyes
(Looking for your eyes)
And now I'm sitting here wondering what to say
(that you might recognize)
Afraid that all these words might scare you away
(And break through the disguise)
No one ever talks about their feelings anyway
Without dressing them in dreams and laughter
I guess it's just too painful otherwise

Look
It's like you're standing in the window
Of a house nobody lives in
And I'm sitting in a car across the way
(Let's just say)
It's an early model chevrolet
(Let's just say)
It's a warm and windy day
You go and pack your sorrow
The trash man comes tomorrow
Leave it at the curb and we'll just roll away",The Late Show,1974
Jackson Browne,"When we come to place where the road and the sky collide
Throw me over the edge and let my spirit glide
They told me I was going to have to work for a living
But all I want to do is ride
I don't care where we're going from here
Honey, you decide

Well I spend my time at the bottom of a wishing well
And I can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell
I used to know where they ended and the world began
But now it's getting hard to tell
I could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell

I'm just rolling away from yesterday
Behind a wheel of a stolen Chevrolet
I'm going to get a little higher
And see if I can hot-wire reality

Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead?
They're going to wash this planet clean like the bible said
Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready
But everybody's gonna get wet
Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet

I'm just rolling away from yesterday
Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet
I'm going to get a little higher
And see if I can hot-wire reality",The Road and the Sky,1974
Jackson Browne,"It's coming from so far away
It's hard to say for sure
Whether what I hear is music or the wind
Through an open door
There's a fire high in the empty sky
Where the sound meets the shore
There's a long distance loneliness
Rolling out over the desert floor

And the years that I spent lost in the mystery
Fall away leaving only the sound of the drum
Like a part of me
It speaks to the heart of me
Forget what life used to be
You are what you choose to be
It's whatever it is you see
That life will become

Whatever it is you might think you have
You have nothing to lose
Through every dead and living thing
Time runs like a fuse
And the fuse is burning
And the earth is turning

Though the years give way to uncertainty
And the fear of living for nothing strangles the will
There's a part of me
That speaks to the heart of me
Though sometimes it's hard to see
It's never far from me
Alive in eternity
That nothing can kill

Oh Lord
Are there really people starving still?
Look out beyond the walls of Babylon
How long will their needs go unfilled
I want to say right now I'm going to be around
I'm going to be around
When the walls and towers are crumbling
When the towers are tumbling down
And I will tune my spirit to the gentle sound
I want to hear the sound
Of the waters lapping on a higher ground
Of the children laughing",The Fuse,1976
Jackson Browne,"Boy of mine
As your fortune comes to carry you down the line
And you watch as the changes unfold
And you sort among the stories you've been told
If some pieces of the picture are hard to find
And the answers to your questions are hard to hold

Take good care of your mother
When you're making up your mind
Should one thing or another take you from behind
Though the world may make you hard and wild
And determine how your life is styled
When you've come to feel that you're the only child
Take good care of your brother

Let the disappointments pass
Let the laughter fill your glass
Let your illusions last until they shatter
Whatever you might hope to find
Among the thoughts that crowd your mind
There won't be many that ever really matter

But take good care of your mother
And remember to be kind
When the pain of another will serve you to remind
That there are those who feel themselves exiled
On whom the fortune never smiled
And upon whose life the heartache has been piled
They're just looking for another
Lonely child

And when you've found another soul
Who sees into your own
Take good care of each other",The Only Child,1976
Jackson Browne,"Maybe the hardest thing I've ever done
Was to walk away from you
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun
I split myself in two

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
Rolling down that hill into the night
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes
From behind each flashing city light

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If loves needs a heart like mine

Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me
She walks by my vacancy sign
Love needs a heart, trusting and blind
I wish that heart was mine

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
I'm afraid to believe the things I feel
I can cry with the best, I can laugh with the rest
But I'm never sure when it's real

And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done
But apart from all that I hope to find
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?
I hope it finds me in time

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If love needs a heart like mine

Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms

They set the young ones up
Under the neon light
Selling day for night
It's alright
Nobody rides for free
Nobody gets it like they want it to be
Nobody hands you any guarantee
Nobody
The hearts are hard and the times are tough
Down on the boulevard the night's enough
And time passes slow
Between the store front shadows and the street lights glow
Everybody walks right by like they're safe or something
They don't know
Nobody knows you
Nobody owes you nothin'
Nobody shows you what they're thinking
Nobody baby
Hey, hey, baby
You got to watch the street, keep your feet
And be on guard
Make it pay baby
It's only time on the boulevard",Boulevard,1980
Jackson Browne,"The sheep`s in the meadow 
The cow`s in the corn
Now is the time for a child to be born
He`ll laugh at the moon
And cry for the sun
And if it`s a boy he`ll carry a gun
Sang the crow on the cradle

And if it should be that this baby`s a girl
Never you mind if her hair doesn`t curl
With rings on her fingers
And bells on her toes
And a bomber above her wherever she goes

Your mother and father will sweat and they`ll slave
To build you a coffin and dig you a grave
Hush-a-bye little one, never you weep
For we`ve got a toy that can put you to sleep
Sang the crow on the cradle

Bring me my gun, and I`ll shoot that bird dead
That`s what your mother and father once said
The crow on the cradle, what can we do
Ah, this is a thing that I`ll leave up to you

Jackson Browne,"Now the seats are all empty
Let the roadies take the stage
Pack it up and tear it down

They're the first to come and last to leave
Working for that minimum wage
They'll set it up in another town

Tonight the people were so fine
They waited there in line
And when they got up on their feet they made the show

And that was sweet
But I can hear the sound
Of slamming doors and folding chairs
And that's a sound they'll never know

Now roll them cases out and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down and get'em up them ramps
'Cause when it comes to moving me
You know you guys are the champs

But when that last guitar's been packed away
You know that I still want to play
So just make sure you got it all set to go
Before you come for my piano

But the band's on the bus
And they're waiting to go
We've got to drive all night and do a show in Chicago

Or Detroit, I don't know
We do so many shows in a row
And these towns all look the same

We just pass the time in our hotel rooms
And wander 'round backstage
Till those lights come up and we hear that crowd
And we remember why we came

Now we got country and western on the bus
are and be	, 
we got disco in eight tracks and cassettes in stereo

We've got rural scenes & magazines
We've got truckers on the CB
We've got Richard Pryor on the video

We got time to think of the ones we love
While the miles roll away
But the only time that seems too short
Is the time that we get to play

People you've got the power over what we do
You can sit there and wait
Or you can pull us through
Come along, sing the song
You know that you can't go wrong

'Cause when that morning sun comes beating down
You're going to wake up in your town
But we'll be scheduled to appear
A thousand miles away from here

People stay just a little bit longer
We want to play, just a little bit longer

Now the promoter don't mind
And the union don't mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song

Please please please, say you will
Say you will

Oh won't you stay
Just a little bit longer

Jackson Browne,"Well I looked into a house I once lived in 
Around the time I first went on my own 
When the roads were as many as the places I had dreamed of 
And my friends and I were one 
Now the distance is done and the search has begun 
I've come to see where my beginnings have gone 

Oh the walls and the windows were still standing 
And the music could be heard at the door 
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions 
Asked if I came very far 
And when my silence replied they took me inside 
Where their children sat playing on the floor 

Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on 
And it left me so warm and so high 
But as I stepped back outside to the grey morning sun 
I heard that highway whisper and sigh 
Are you ready to fly? 

And I looked into the faces all passing by 
It's an ocean that will never be filled 
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles 
That even love cannot rebuild 
It's a hotel at best, you're here as a guest 
You oughta make yourself at home while you're waiting for the rest 

Well I looked into dream of the millions 
That one day the search will be through 
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions 
Looking into you 

The great song traveler passed through here 
And he opened my eyes to the view 
And I was among those who called him a prophet 
And I asked him what was true 
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone 
Now I'm looking in my life for a truth that is my own 

Well I looked into the sky for my anthem 
And the words and the music came through 
But words and music can never touch the beauty that I've seen 
Looking into you -- and that's true",Looking into You,1983
Jackson Browne,"Maybe the hardest thing I've ever done
Was to walk away from you
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun
I split myself in two

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
Rolling down that hill into the night
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes
From behind each flashing city light

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If loves needs a heart like mine

Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me
She walks past my vacancy sign
Love needs a heart, trusting and blind
I wish that heart was mine

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
I'm afraid to believe the things I feel
I can cry with the best I can laugh with the rest
But I'm never sure when it's real
And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done
But apart from all that I hope to find
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?
I hope it finds me in time

If love needs a heart like mine",Love Needs a Heart,1983
Jackson Browne,"Highways and dance halls
A good song takes you far
Your write about the moon
And you dream about the stars
Blues in old motel rooms
Girls in daddy's car
You sing about the nights
And you laugh about the scars
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms
Phone calls long distance
To tell how you've been
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins

And when you stop to let em know
You've got it down
Its just another town along the road

The ladies come to see you
If your name still rings a bell
They give you damn near nothin
And they'll say they knew you well
So you tell em you'll remember
But they know its just a game
And along the way their faces
All begin to look the same
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the road

Well it isn't for the money
And its only for a while
You stalk about the rooms
And you roll away the miles

And your towers are turning

Gliding in one place like Jesus in the sky 
We all must do the best we can 
And then hang on to that Gospel plow

To stand before the Father

So she could get in and see the show
Well, I sat her down right next to me

And you see the life that you've left behind
When you think it over do you ever wonder? 
What it is that holds your life so close to mine

You love the thunder and you love the rain
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain
And before the lightning fades and you surrender
You've got a second to look at the dark side of the man

You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
And I know you wonder how you ever came
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame

Draw the shade and light the fire
For the night that holds you and calls your name
And just like your lover, knows your desire
And the crazy longing that time will never tame

You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name

But you can never go back the way you came

Between the stillness in my heart

Somebody turns the corner out of sight
Looking for somebody

Tender, when you hold your baby tight
Tender, tender are the motions, tender is the night
Between a life that we expected
And the way it's always been
I can't walk back in again
After the way we fight
When just outside there are people laughing
Living lives we used to lead
Chasing down the love they need
Somewhere in the night
Tender is the night
Tender, and the benediction of the neon light
Tender, tender are the hunters, tender is the night

Jackson Browne,"A man stands up before his God and country
Raises his right hand and takes an oath
Swears he has acted in the line of duty
And he more than anyone wants to tell the truth

But there is a need to keep somethings a secret
Some weapons shipments, some private wars
In the future democracy will be defended
Behind closed doors

Now the men of Congress who convene to determine
If covert war is a business or a crime
Are the same men who routinely give their permission
For the shedding of blood in security's name

And there is a need to keep some things a secret
The names of some countries, the terms of some deals
And above all the sound of the screams of the innocent
Beneath our wheels
Does the word justice mean anything to you?
Are the features of a lie beginning to come through?

In the streets of America the children are buried
Caught in an avalanche of weapons and drugs
They live and they die in the bowels of a business
That disguised as a war between The Crips and The Bloods

And there is a need to keep some things a secret
The C.I.A. deals protecting the source
And the government policies directly connecting the drugs and our wars
Does the word justice mean anything to you?
As the battlefield comes home and democracy falls through

I am waiting for the time to come
When the word will be real for everyone
And not just a word but a thing that can be done
Justice must be won

We only talk about what happened last
We try to move ahead but we're losing ground

I wait for your angels to carry me home

Waiting for you
I have no problem telling right from wrong
Fiction from what's true
No problem telling the dream from the dawn

My problem is you
Waiting here for you

I wanted to live in the realm of the senses
You've got to know how

Our love is a fire
Our love is a wave moving deep in an ocean

I play the cards I drew
No problem with the changes life has hurled

Jackson Browne,"In the calling out to one another
Of the lovers up and down the strand
In the sound of the waves and the cries
Of the seagulls circling the sand

In the fragments of the songs
Carried down the wind from some radio
In the murmuring of the city in the distance
Ominous and low

I hear the sound of the world where we played
And the far too simple beauty of the promises we made

If you ever need holding
Call my name, and I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through
Sky blue and black

Where the touch of the lover ends
And the soul of the friend begins
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one
And a struggle neither wins

But you gave me the world I was in
And a place I could make a stand
I could never see how you doubted me
When I'd let go of your hand

Yeah, and I was much younger then
And I must have thought that I would know
If things were going to end

And the heavens were rolling
Like a wheel on a track
And our sky was unfolding
And it'll never fold back
Sky blue and black

And I'd have fought the world for you
(I'd have fought the world for you)
If I thought that you wanted me to
Or put aside what was true or untrue (true or untrue)
If I'd know that's what you needed
What you needed me to do

But the moment has passed by me now
You have put away my pride
And just come through for you somehow

If you ever need holding
Call my name, I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through

You're the color of the sky
Reflected in each store-front window pane
You're the whispering and the sighing of my tires in the rain

You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost
In everything I do
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you
In the sunlight and the shadows

And the faces on the avenue
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
Sky, sky blue and black",Sky Blue and Black,1994

All in their silver frames

And two of you
Two who have betrayed love
And two who have been true

Every bond and vow and faith we knew
Me and the fool I've been
And the two of you

Of the two of me
One always knew
That I would always love you
Whatever you might do
And the more unfree and troubled you grew
I could feel the whole world splitting in two
Trying to make the room
For the two of you

So like a fragile little child
More than a little lost and wild
How the light would leave the sky when you cried
And returned again when you smiled
And how the light would invade and divide
The darkness I have inside

There were two of me
And two of you

Around the corner you can hear the sound
People dancing around the golden calf

Like a homeless child's fitfull dreams
Smiling faces free from wanting
Life's abundances beyond counting

Close your distances, find your angels
Lose your fears and meet your dangers

Running into the sun
In the rush of youth, for love and truth

Now we awake with a world at stake
And a race we run

Jackson Browne,"The words had all been spoken
And somehow the feeling still wasn't right
And still we continued on through the night
Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the air
Trying to understand how our lives has led us there

Looking hard into your eyes
There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone

Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they don't mean that much
Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch
You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be

Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting alone through the night
How long have I been dreaming I could make it right
If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might
To be the one you need

Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting alone through the night
How long have I been running for that morning flight

To the prisoner inside me
To the captive of my doubt
Who among his fantasies harbors the dream of breaking out
And taking his chances

With its heartbreak and its joy
With it constantly giving birth to life and to forces that destroy

In the shade of the freeway
Gonna pack my lunch in the morning
And go to work each day
And when the evening rolls around
I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again
Amen
Say it again
Amen

I want to know what became of the changes
We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening
I've been aware of the time going by
They say in the end it's the wink of an eye
When the morning light comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again
Amen

Caught between the longing for love
And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor
Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the Pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there

Ah the laughter of the lovers
As they run through the night
Leaving nothing for the others
But to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight

I'm gonna find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint by number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again

I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
In those things that money can buy
Thought true love could have been a contender
Are you there
Say a prayer for the Pretender
Who started out so young and strong
Only to surrender

Say a prayer for the pretender
Are you there for the pretender

Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right.

I heard her talkin' with her friend when she thought nobody else was around.
She said she's got to be somebody's baby; she must be somebody's baby.
Cause when the cars and the signs and the street lights light up the town,

She's got to be somebody's baby;
She must be somebody's baby;
She's got to be somebody's baby.
She's so

She's gonna be somebody's only light.
Gonna shine tonight.
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight.

I try to shut my eyes, but I can't get her outta my sight.
I know I'm gonna know her, but I gotta get over my fright.
We'll, I'm just gonna walk up to her.
I'm gonna talk to her tonight.

I've been the one who has been frightened
And almost borne away by the very thoughts
That I feared yesterday
And it must be the dust or smoke that's in my eyes

How can I cry about something from someone I won't see
Oh my friends all say she had her chance
Let's go shoot some pool
Ya know a fool is just a fool
And I've tried everything that whiskey cures
But the pain endures and now I'm feeling that pain
I put my pride in my pocket
That's how I'll spend my loneliest days
And it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes

Don't know what to do
Hold the lamp above the rafters
These smoke-filled rooms will not replace her
I've been the one who has been frightened
And almost borne away by the very thoughts
That I feared yesterday
And it must be dust or smoke that's in my eyes

Jackson:
When I was a young man I'd never been kissed;
I got to thinking about what I had missed.
I found a girl. I kissed her and then...
Oh lord, I kissed her again.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Bonnie:
He asked me to marry and be his sweet wife;
We would be happy -- all of our life.
He begged and he pleaded like a natural man, and then...
Oh lord, I gave him my hand.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Jackson:
I worked mighty hard and so did my wife;
Working hand in hand to make a good life.
Corn in the field and wheat in the bins, and then...
Oh lord, I was the father of twins.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Bonnie:
Our children numbered just about four
And they all had sweethearts knocking on the door.
They all got married and they didn't wait, I was...
Oh lord! a grandmother of eight!

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Jackson:
Now we are old and ready to go
Thinking about what happened a long time ago.

Bonnie:
We had lots of kids and trouble and pain, but...
Oh lord, we'd do it again.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

And buddy, that was good enough for me

It was a Sunday night I will never forget,
Driving down the street in my red Camaro,
As I pulled in to the seven eleven,
The locals eyed a stranger that they did not know.

Challenger he's the new contender,
Challenger and he better know
Challenger we don't want no trouble from
The Challenger in the red Camaro.

He made his move and he made his challenge,
""Anybody want to put his pink on the line?""
Behind the wheel slipped the local hero,
REady set go and their engines whined.

The air was tense from the screaming metal thunder,
The challenger's machine ate up the local hero's
But when the dust cleared instead of his pink slip,
I had the hero's baby in my red Camaro.

Challenger I'm the new contender,
Challenger forget about your baby,
Now she rides in my red Camaro...

But there were things about her you didn't understand

Yeah Baby, tell me how you're gonna keep that promise now?
To live your life without regret and make it work with what you get

You didn't then, but now you know
When she began to lie, you really should have let her go

You're learnin' how to talk about it, you're learnin' how to bend
It's like you're learning how to walk all over again

Yeah Baby, tell me who you're gonna give your lovin' to?
That girl who catches every eye or the one you can set your compass by

You set it by her soulful smile, the fire in her eye
And the way she goes that extra mile
The love you wanted this to be is somewhere down the line
You'll find her eventually

Your grandma and her grandma are sittin' 'round heaven discussin' the law
Lovin' that girl was not your crime, livin' without her gonna take some time

Knowing she never could pass on a dare
And knowing it sounded more desperate than reckless or bold
I just put it out there cold, too far gone to care

My eyes on the road, she slid herself down in the seat
And a vision of paradise swung into view
Across those five lanes not one driver glanced over to see
The beauty known only to me, and a big rig or two

On that freeway the light was receding
Her beauty, a sight so misleading
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone
On the naked ride home

With the trace of a smile and that defiant look in her eye
She hurtled through space in a world of her own
And turning aside my caress spoke of all that she'd not yet done
As if I was the doubting one who would have to be shown

On that freeway the light was receding
Her beauty, a sight so misleading
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone
On the naked ride home

She gathered her clothes
And ran through the yard in the dark
Up onto the porch like a flash, and inside
Then one room at a time
I watched every light in our house come on
Like the truth that would eventually dawn
Forcing me to decide

But on that freeway the light was receding

You lose your grip and then you slip
Into the masterpiece
And maybe I had miles to drive
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive
A thousand kisses deep

And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

Confined to sex we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me
I made it to the forward deck
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked
A thousand kisses deep

I'm turning tricks I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep
And quiet is the thought of you
The file on you complete
Except what we forgot to do
A thousand kisses deep

And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

The ponies run, the girls are young
The odds are there to beat
You win a while and then it's done
Your little winning streak
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat
You live your life as if it's real

Jackson Browne,"Everybody I talk to is ready to leave
With the light of the morning
They've seen the end coming down
Long enough to believe
That they've heard their last warning
Standing alone
Each has his own ticket in his hand
And as the evening descends
I sit thinking 'bout Everyman

Seems like I've always been
Looking for some other place
To get it together
Where with a few of my friends
I could give up the race
And maybe find something better
But all my fine dreams
Well though out schemes
To gain the motherland
Have all eventually come down
To waiting for Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand
Waiting here for Everyman
Don't ask me if he'll show, baby I don't know

Make it on your own if you think you can
Somewhere later on you'll have to take a stand
Then you're going to need a hand

Everybody's just waiting to hear from the one
Who can give them the answers
And lead them back to that place
In the warmth of the sun
Where sweet childhood still dances
Who'll come along
And hold out that strong
That gentle father's hand
Long ago I heard someone say
Something 'bout Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own
Make it  if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand

I'm not trying to tell you
That I've seen the plan
Turn and walk away if you think I am
But don't think too badly
Of one who's left holding sand
He's just another dreamer
Dreaming 'bout Everyman",For Everyman [Live],2008
Jackson Browne,"I'm going to rent myself a house
In the shade of the freeway
Gonna pack my lunch in the morning
And go to work each day
And when the evening rolls around
I'll go on home and lay my body down
And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again
Amen.
Say it again
Amen.

I want to know what became of the changes
We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening?
I've been aware of the time going by
They say in the end it's the wink of an eye
When the morning light comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again
Amen.

Caught between the longing for love
And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender.
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor
Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the Pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there

Ah the laughter of the lovers
As they run through the night
Leaving nothing for the others
But to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight

I'm gonna find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint-by-number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again

I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie 
In those things that money can buy
Thought true love could have been a contender
Are you there?
Say a prayer for the Pretender.
Who started out so young and strong
Only to surrender.

Are you prepared for the pretender?",The Pretender [Live],2008

Jackson Browne,"I went to the live nude cabaret
To see what I could see
And I saw the ladies dancing
An I guess that they saw me
Neither did I vanquish, or surrender to desire
Was just more fuel on the fire

I?ve heard form follows function
And I think that must be true
Especially when you think of
What the female form will do
Its lines and shapes are everywhere
As if they follow me
Repeating my own longing in everything I see

Star of happiness, star of love
Lead us to the shore
That only women hold the promise of
Men would give them money
And men would give them gold
And shower them with promises
Of luxury untold
And make their vessels of creation
The temples of our souls
Ohhhhh let my people go

Sea of loneliness, sea of love
Carry me upon your endless depths
And bear my heart above
For I would give her money
And I would give her jewelry
And lead her to the palace my imagination rules
And fashion from her nakedness
The innocence that?s gone
Gone as the time she?s given the suffering of fools

Without ideals or violence,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire.
People carry roses,
Make promises by the hours,
My love she laughs like the flowers,
Valentines can't buy her.

In the dime stores and bus stations,
People talk of situations,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Some speak of the future,
My love she speaks softly,
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all.

The cloak and dagger dangles,
Madams light the candles.
In ceremonies of the horsemen,
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Statues made of match sticks,
Crumble into one another,
My love winks, she does not bother,
She knows too much to argue or to judge.

The bridge at midnight trembles,
The country doctor rambles,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.

The night blows cold and rainy,

At my window with a broken wing.",Love Minus Zero/No Limit [#],2012

Jackson Browne,"Oh how sadly sound the songs the queen must sing of dying
A prisoner upon her throne of melancholy sighing
If she could see her mirror now
She would be free of those who bow and
Scrape the ground before her feet

Silently she walks among her dying midnight roses
Watches as each moment goes that never really know us
And so it seems she doesn't care
If she has dreams of no one there
Within the shadows of her room

But all my frozen words agree, and say it's time to
Call back, all the birds I sent to
Fly behind her castle walls, and I'm
Weary of the nights I've seen
Inside these empty halls

Wooden lady turn and turn among my weary secrets
And wave within the hours past and other empty pockets
Maybe we've found what we have lost
When we've unwound so many crossed entangling
Misunderstandings; but

To Oakland just to see them play?
We've come such a long way today

Got some drugs in the bathroom stall
Sneaking beer into an empty unlit hall
I sent you a postcard today
Don't mind the message

That was a good time we'll never have again
Glad to see it end

I've put some miles on these eyes
I've put some scars on these broken hands of mine
Punching walls and valentine's to you
I missed another

Gone for a year today, can't see you now 
I'm leaving anyway
I'm at the bar for you waiting",All the Way,2003
Jackson United,"Left home and kept on leaving
Walked off into this morning
Sunrise cuts the darkness
Steps and stares with well worn warning
Touch down, a perfect landing
Missing but he's still standing, barely

English sunset, sun in your eyes
Dusk sweeps over us tonight
Rainy Brixton holidays
Red brick parks and alleyways
Lion's Roar silenced and still
A test of strength, test of our will, waiting

I'll aim right for you (repeat)
A waiting van, a passing phase
Phone calls from you to pass the days
From caffeine highs to midnight lows
Punch drunk heartache blow by blow
I'll wait for you in hotel rooms
In rain soaked days we pass the gloom
The Northern Star tonight will set the course

English sunset, sweet goodbyes
The wind is in our sails tonight
Rainy Brixton memories
I pull myself closer to me
The Lion's Roar in vain tonight
A distant call, a distant light, someday

I'll aim right for you (repeat)
A waiting van, a passing phase
Phone calls from you to pass the days
From caffeine highs to midnight lows
Punch drunk heartache blow by blow
I'll wait for you in hotel rooms

Make me fix you again
Driven deeper than anything
Beyond the valley fo the diamond ring

Live between the black and blue
Left with a question there's no answer to

Find your way from the wreck and rubble

Jacksoul,"Our song used to be my lullaby
Now it's just a tune from days gone by
Now it only haunts me in my sleep
And i soak my pillow when i weep
I drop my tears
I drop my tears.

I remember when we danced
Then world fell away but my heart held to you.
I remember when we fell in love
I close my eyes. i can still believe you're here.
I remember when you left.
I cried as i prayed i would soon forget you.
I never will. i never will.

With loneliness, i wonder 'round in shame
As memories of you run down like rain.
Asleep at night i still call out your name.
As the storm clouds beat a cold refrain
Against my window pane.

[chorus]
I know that life is simpler now
But is it even worthwhile?
I said was it all worth it, baby?

I know that he's the safer bet
But i'm the best you had yet.
There ain't no denying
I ain't even tryin' to get over my baby
No, no, no....

Let me call you, sweetie pie
Say you wanna be my lady

Say you'll be my sugar dumplin'

It's five o'clock in the morning
And we're up lounging with the moon
Day is fast approaching
And I'll be leaving soon

It's not long till it's on again
And you're calling, calling, calling to me
And I know I won't be leaving
'Cause I can't let you be

Can I tell the world you love me to?
I just wanna know how it is
Ain't nobody gonna mess with this

I don't wanna play around no more
Here's my heart
Now tell me what it's for

Tell me that you wanna be my baby
Till the end of time
Tell my that you wanna be my baby
Till the end of time

I just wanna call you, baby

I gotta learn how to face it

Jacksoul,"The midnight sky is starless
But an autumn moon it calls to me.
Like a tide tongues round an island,
How your naked soul it calls to me.
I come to you in silence.
I sing to you with breath alone.
We'll be each other's tyrants
Or maybe passion's slaves gone overboard.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.
Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

The midnight air enfolds us
As silken shadows glide in sweet caress.
And nature's hand controls us.
So let us drink the wine of carelessness
If cosmic fates entomb us
Let the fires burn from well within
And from hunger's pool consume us.
Let the perfect nameless dance begin.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.
Let me dream with you
Let me dream with you
Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

Here in the darkness
Isn't where the passion ever starts.
We float together,
The deepest hungers happening in the heart.

The midnight sky is starless
But an autumn moon it calls to me.
Like a tide tongues round an island,
How your naked soul it calls to me.
I come to you in silence.
I sing to you with breath alone.
We'll be each other's tyrants
Or maybe passion's slaves gone overboard.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.
Let me dream with you
Let me dream with you
Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

Let me dream with you in sleepless love.

Tuesday I am fading
And By Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, its your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there.

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yea

On a Monday I am waiting
By Tuesday I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Rest my head on something real

And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'

Yo this is strictly a club record
Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold
When the F-L-E-X was spinnin at the Red Zone, hooded down
And these tired bouncers would not let me in
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, yo, yo
I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector
(Stop drop the Rock's up in here)
Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble
Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles
But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney
and ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi
Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk
The needle ain't skip the record jerked
Cause y'all jumpin' too hard

What? I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio

Yo cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin
Yo Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley
(It doesn't matter you just bought a fresh Bentley!)

How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue
And you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
And they start it off like this
Electric slide on the dance floor
Freaky-deaky like Studio 54
GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it
Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearin' so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?

We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die

Jacky you keep them rollers in your hair
With that plastic on your head huh?
Man, hey Keith who did your jheri curls man? They look good
I seen y'all this morning on Cops man

They had y'all pictures, all your profiles and everything
Y'all should stay low... Gene called
He need five dollars

Ultimate focus behind your neck kid
We flex with tecs on your lyrical index
Stop the masses, rotate the fastest
Afro jheri curl world, get ignited

Reinvited on your Main Sources like the enforcers
Submachines spray your Liberace pianoes
Freestyle ambulances, bring out your new dancers
While why'all can't rap, we took your Ampex

We have protective custody
Got your face disgustin me - with animal like instincts
I left a dead gorilla in a skating rink
Penetrate your Gap jeans with Black & Decker machines

Alternate your skullies, catch dead rats in Saran Wrap
Put used diapers on your windshield wipers
Make you eat your own feces, sell you {?}lindrum elyses{?}
Pull out your colon, leave your gland swollen

Uncircumcised between your mom's thighs
That's right, with a face like Michael Myers
I clip the ears off your bodyguards with bloody pliers
Bound to eat a German shepherd in the Mojabe desert

While y'all talk gangster, I push body parts in shopping carts
Leave wigs on streets on Melrose so coroners can smell those
Arms for three days, with three legs in the backseat
Y'all get the back heat - with the police department

Scared to look in my apartment
Three weeks ago I dumped a bag of legs with beer kegs
Went to Rouse and bought a six-pack and some eggs
Seen my face in the paper with a beard, went home and shaved

Took out your bodies in the pickup truck, back to the grave
Drinkin' Yoohoo's and donuts, y'all punks think I'm so nuts
Walkin' in hospital rooms like the black Dr. Dooom
Push you in the wheelchair, out the window

Down the steps like Ironside, you run and hide
Handicapped with no maps, I'm after you, throw gas at you

Vagina with bugs rubs cubs, getting fellatio

With a belt around my waist like book me

Up the street with human feet colored apple-green
With spots eatin blueberry pop tarts
With the eighth body in my trunk my elbow bleeds with lumps
Walkin from the sanitation dump with rotten skulls
On my waterbed with miller beer kegs
Blood in my cabinet, ears in my closet
Watchin the raptors play the houston rockets
With your arms in the freezer I grab a icicle
Puttin fingerprints on my bicycle
Walkin up to have a drink at the club ?there is? three Irish chicks
Lookin at me like I'm sick
Walkin by chin-chins I stole the keys from ya friends
Lookin out ya madrion hotel window like Elvis Presley
Coming down the elevator
Good evening mister excuse me pardon me with body parts
And credit cards walkin down sunset boulevard past the red light
I threw a rat with mayonnaise at ya head lights
Four blonde girls screamed and put on their hi-beams
I fake like I'm ?vomiting smoking sick? threw acid on their stomachs
And drove of with a wig down la brea listen to a tape by slayer
Parked in a parking lot behind burger king
Eatin a raw pack of chicken wings
With blood on my fingers I blast a CD by the staple singers
The cops told me to turn it down,
They like my shoes from buster brown
I went up the block an bought some incense
For the wrong smells in the air conditioner vents

Blocked out the traffic an' blocked out the sun,
Straight for home all the people did run,

We talked of the end of the world, and then
We'd sing a song an' then sing it again.
We'd sit for an hour an' not say a word,
And then these words would be heard:

Sweethearts sat in the dark and sparked,
They hugged and kissed in that dusty old dark.
They sighed and cried, hugged and kissed,
Instead of marriage, they talked like this:
""Honey,""

Now, the telephone rang, an' it jumped off the wall,
That was the preacher, a-makin' his call.
He said, ""Kind friend, this may the end;
An' you got your last chance of salvation of sin!""

The churches was jammed, and the churches was packed,
An' that dusty old dust storm blowed so black.
Preacher could not read a word of his text,
An' he folded his specs, an' he took up collection,
Said,",Dusty Old Dust (So Long It's Been Good to Know You),2000
Jacky Terrasson,"On the 14th day of April of 1935,
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.
You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black,
And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.
From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.

The radio reported, we listened with alarm,
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw.

From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long.

Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks.
And the family it was crowded into their little room,
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom.

The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown.

It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,
We rattled down that highway to never come back again.




",The Great Dust Storm (Dust Storm Disaster),2000
Jacky Terrasson,"Back in Nineteen Twenty-Seven,
I had a little farm and I called that heaven.
Well, the prices up and the rain come down,
And I hauled my crops all into town --
I got the money, bought clothes and groceries,
Fed the kids, and raised a family.

Rain quit and the wind got high,
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky.
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,
And I poured it full of this gas-I-line --
And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin',
Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl.

Way up yonder on a mountain road,
I had a hot motor and a heavy load,
I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin',
A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin' --
Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind,
There was a feller there, a mechanic feller,
Said it was en-gine trouble.

Way up yonder on a mountain curve,
It's way up yonder in the piney wood,
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove,
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could --
Commence coastin', pickin' up speed,
Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it.

Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you,
The fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world --
Scattered wives and children's
All over the side of that mountain.

We got out to the West Coast broke,
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak,
An' I bummed up a spud or two,
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew --
We poured the kids full of it,
Mighty thin stew, though,
You could read a magazine right through it.
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner,
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it.

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I been hearin' his name all over the land.

Well, what is a vigilante man?
Tell me, what is a vigilante man?
Has he got a gun and a club in his hand?
Is that is a vigilante man?

Rainy night down in the engine house,
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse,
Man come along an' he chased us out in the rain.
Was that a vigilante man?

Stormy days we passed the time away,
Sleepin' in some good warm place.
Man come along an' we give him a little race.
Was that a vigilante man?

Preacher Casey was just a workin' man,
And he said, ""Unite all you working men.""
Killed him in the river some strange man.
Was that a vigilante man?

Oh, why does a vigilante man,
Why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

I rambled 'round from town to town,
I rambled 'round from town to town,
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle.
Was that the vigilante men?

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've heard his name all over this land.

Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well

Comes a-rumbling down the canyon to meet that salty tide
Of the wide Pacific Ocean where the sun sets in the west
And the big Grand Coulee country in the land I love the best

Everybody wondered why
It was the landlord and the soldiers that they hired
To nail Jesus Christ in the sky

Jacky Terrasson,"Il faut savoir encore sourire
Quand le meilleur s'est retiré
Et qu'il ne reste que le pire
Dans une vie bête à pleurer

Il faut savoir, coûte que coûte
Garder toute sa dignité
Et malgré ce qu'il nous en coûte
S'en aller sans se retourner

Face au destin qui nous désarme
Et devant le bonheur perdu
Il faut savoir cacher ses larmes
Mais moi, mon cœur, je n'ai pas su

Il faut savoir quitter la table
Lorsque l'amour est desservi
Sans s'accrocher l'air pitoyable
Mais partir sans faire de bruit

Il faut savoir cacher sa peine
Sous le masque de tous les jours
Et retenir les cris de haine
Qui sont les derniers mots d'amour

Il faut savoir rester de glace
Et taire un cœur qui meurt déjà
Il faut savoir garder la face

I do pretty well, till after sundown

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending

You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Jacky Terrasson,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love

And yelling at the umpire at a baseball game
Window shopping, popcorn popping

Change the world's diapers that is

Puts a brown bag under his arm
Walks down the street till he gets into a big box
Crawls inside and has a sea,t in a cardboard box
In the city, New York City stop

Its liquid heat but it makes a meal
Finally takes a drink and he shakes his head

I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, can you spare a dime?'

Well, I'm standing on the edge of insanity
Looking over the edge
Things look greener on the other side
Sit around and worry about things
Wonder why, till I literally breakdown and cry

And it seems as though I've reached out
And slapped the world on the balls
Grabbed it by the throat
Slammed it up against the wall

Life's ladder is so hard to climb
So won't you spare a moment of your time
I'll do a dance, sing you a rhyme
And say, 'Hey mister, can you spare a dime?'

Take it on back to Georgia boys, yeah

So if you're looking down on me
Don't like what you see

Grab me by the throat
And slam me up against the wall

Jaco Pastorius,"I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shocked love away

There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees

I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

I know, no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality, to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way",Hejira,2003
Jaco Pastorius,"There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot!
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery

Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery

We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's nordic blues
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me

You could talk like a fool-I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keyloids
From the ""slings and arrows of outrageous romance""
I stole that from Willy the Shake!
You know, ""Neither a borrower nor a lender be""
Romeo, Romeo talk to me!

Is your silence that golden?
Are you comfortable in it?
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison?
Are you gagged by your ribbons?
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!
Come and spend some on me,
Shut me up and talk to me!
I'm always talking!
Chicken squawking!
Please talk to me",Talk to Me,2007
Jaco Pastorius,"I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise!

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it
He kept ringing bells
Nothing to it!

He got three oranges
Three lemons
Three cherries
Three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck!
It's just luck!
You get a little lucky and you make a little money!

I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room
With their big balloons
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose!
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears
And lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there!

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell
(In some ways)
Since I lost every dime
I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John
And get twenty for one
It's just luck!",The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines,2007

Jacob Collier,"Take me
Anywhere you want to go
You know that my love is strong
In my hideaway
Softly
Like the calm that follows storm
Find what I've been searching for, all along
In my hideaway

Even when I close my eyes
Darling, I will always stay
Wide awake
In my hideaway

Touch me
Like I've never loved before
In a place that I adore
In my hideaway
I know
Whichever way the wind may blow
There will be a place for me to go
In my hideaway

Whether you be lost of found
Darling, if you've gone astray
I'm on my way
To my hideaway
My hideaway

Down going down
Down falling down
Down goin' down
Follow down

When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me

Let me
Feel the sky and feel the moon
Let me sing an honest tune
To my hideaway

Trusting
Wherever I go wandering 
I’ll find a home in everything
In my hideaway

Maybe you can come to stay
And I will meet you here someday

Lost in a clouded mind
Held down by all the things that seem so real
The world you can't leave behind

You've made all of the money you could spens
You're begging for something more
Behind the prison tou call your home my friends
The light in the endless dark

Lately, you've followed your fears under the bed
And fell for a hundred years
Into the arms of a wounded melody
The promise that love's still here

You held a cynical world like God's bruised fruit
Chopped from a sacred tree
It's us, the enemy we fought all these years
The stories of you and me

So we hurry, go faster and faster to find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sweetest view
There's a buzz like a lightbulb up to our ears
Promise that love's still here

Retrace the steps in the snow to find your friend
'Cause the child had melt so fast
Big dreams, the future you taste on summer's time
Having it just won't last

Right here, we've all got the answer in our heart
If we could just let that go
Lifetimes of beautiful Sunday church bell girls
The junkies upon the floor

So we hurry, go faster and faster to find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sweetest view
We could argue forever and ever, be clear
Promise that love's still here

If forever and ever and ever we find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sacred view
There's a buzz like a lightbuld up to our ears
Promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here

The sound and fury we compose
A baby tiger in the throws

And if you don't love me
You’ll be a kamikaze flying circles
Around my heart and when my guard
Is down you'll tear my ship apart

Jacob Golden,"I tried to write the perfect song
To let you know that I was wrong
And fix the bloody hole in the roof
Where the hammer fell

My shoes, they fall in foreign places
Looking for my other in a sea of faces
A girl and a boy in the corner
Where the hammer fell

Sometimes I wonder
Is there someone there to carry you
On their shoulders for just a little longer?

I was stuck, stuck, stuck in the past
I saw you at amoeba and we fell so fast
But fairy tales always fade
And the bruises last

I finally wrote the perfect song
I played it in my bedroom all night long
I thought of you but I couldn't call
And the hammer falls

Sometimes I wonder
Is there someone there to carry you
On their shoulders for just a little longer?

At twenty five, I bought a sampler
When my band broke up
I thought I lost my spark
That old reaper left it's mark

Sometimes I throw myself around

Sometimes I wonder
Is there someone there to carry you
On their shoulders for just a little longer?

You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends

Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me",You Make Me Feel Brand New,1990

Jacob Miller,"Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
Woo woo woo 
Woo woo woo
 
Someone to take on a walk by the lake Lord, let it be me
Someone who's shy, someone who'd cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin' me
You're just a dream, and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
But if you were here with me
I'd feel so happy, I could cry
You are so dear to me
I just can't let you say goodbye
Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo
Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo
Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo
Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo

Until the highway ends""

With his arms in the air and a mighty cry
""Don't forget that James Dean died
For all of our sins""

Jacoby Shaddix,"Tonight, there's gonna be a fight
So if you need a place to go
Got two room slum, a mattress and a gun
And the cops don't never show

So come right in 'cause everybody sins
Welcome to the scene of the crime
You want it? Believe it? We got it if you need it
The devil is a friend of mine

If you think it's crazy, you ain't seen a thing
Just wait until we're going down in flames

We are, we are the saints, we signed our life away
Doesn't matter what you think, we're gonna do it anyway
We are, we are the saints, one day you will confess
And pray to the saints of Los Angeles

Red line tripping on a land mine, sipping at the Troubadour
Girls passed out naked in the back lounge, everybody's gonna score
She's all jacked up, she's down on her luck
You want it, you need it, the devils gonna feed it

Don't you say, it's crazy, you don't know a thing

Jacoby Shaddix,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
And funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Je me souviens du temps, du temps charmant
Ou sous le cerisier le coeur grisé tu m'as parlé d'amour

Comme au premier jour toujours, toujours
Je revois le matin ou le destin mettait sur mon chemin
Dans le creux de ta main mes plus beaux lendemains

Mon horizon, mon rayon de soleil
C'est toi dès ton réveil qui fais ma plus jolie chanson
Comme au premier jour toujours, toujours
Le printemps refleurit quand tu souris
Et me donne la joie de te sentir à moi autant qu'au premier jour

Si tu partais un jour
Bousculant le passé
Je renierais l'amour
Qui m'aurait tant blessé
Ne vole pas ce qui nous appartient
Ne détruit pas mon bonheur et le tien.

Comme au premier jour toujours, toujours
Je reverrai le temps
Le temps charmant où sous le cerisier
Le coeur grisé tu m'a parlé d'amour
Comme au premier jour toujours, toujours,
Nous irons tous les deux heureux, heureux
Sur le même chemin cueillir des lendemains
Qui n'auront pas de fin

Pour un grand amour il faudrait mon amour
Que l'on soit mon amour tous les deux.
Les heures passent sans bonheur ni chagrin
Je n'attends que demain pour retrouver ta main
Les heures passent que l'on pourrait passer
A s'embrasser... à s'embrasser...

Pour un grand amour il faudrait mon amour
Que l'on soit mon amour tous les deux.
Tous les mots d'amour de tes lettres d'amour
Ne valent pas l'amour de tes yeux.

Doit nous mettre à l'abri tous les deux.
Dans le même ciel c'est le même arc-en-ciel

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know

I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Jacqueline François,"On l'appell’ Mad’moisell’ de Paris
Et sa vie c'est un petit peu la nôtre 
Son royaume c’est la rue d’Rivoli
Son destin, c’est d'habiller les autres 
On dit qu'elle est petite main
Et s'il est vrai qu'elle n'est pas grande
Que de bouquets et de guirlandes
A-t-elle semés sur nos chemins.

Elle chante un air de son faubourg
Elle rêve à des serments d'amour
Elle pleure et plus souvent qu'à son tour
Mad’moiselle de Paris

Elle donne tout le talent qu'elle a
Pour faire un bal à l'Opéra
Et file à la porte des Lilas
Mad’moiselle de Paris
Il fait beau
Et là-haut
Elle va coudre un cœur à son manteau

Mais le cœur d'une enfant de Paris
C'est pareil aux bouquets de violettes
On l'attache au corsage un samedi
Le dimanche on le perd à la fête
Adieu guinguette, adieu garçon
La voilà seule avec sa peine
Et recommence la semaine,
Et recommence la chanson

Elle chante un air de son faubourg
Elle rêve à des serments d'amour
Elle pleure et plus souvent qu'à son tour
Mad’moiselle de Paris

Elle donne un peu de ses vingt ans
Pour faire une collection d'printemps
Et seule s'en va rêver sur un banc
Mad’moiselle de Paris
Trois petits tours
Un bonjour
Elle oublie qu'elle a pleuré d'amour

Elle chante et son cœur est heureux
Elle rêve et son rêve est tout bleu
Elle pleure mais ça n'est pas bien sérieux
Mad’moiselle de Paris
Elle vole à petits pas pressés
Elle court vers les Champs Elysées
Et donne un peu de son déjeuner
Aux moineaux des Tuil’ries
Elle fredonne, elle sourit
Et voilà Mad’moiselle de Paris.",Mademoiselle de Paris,1995
Jacqueline François,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Le  Piano De Mauvaise Vie (Jeru),2010

Quand les soldats par quatre
Attendent les massacres
Sur le quai d'une gare
Pourquoi ce train ventru
Qui ronronne et soupire
Avant de nous conduire

Pourquoi les chants les cris
Des foules venues fleurir

Au nom de leurs conneries

Où finit notre chance

Chargé d'hommes en gris
Repeints en une nuit

Pour faire une bonne dame patronnesse
Il faut être bonne, mais sans faiblesse
Ainsi, j’ai dû rayer de ma liste
Une pauvresse qui fréquentait un socialiste

Jacques Brel,"Dors ma mie
Dehors la nuit est noire
Dors ma mie bonsoir
Dors ma mie
C'est notre dernier soir
Dors ma mie bonsoir

Sur les fleurs qui ferment leurs paupières
Pleure la pluie légère
Et l'oiseau qui chantera l'aurore
Dors et rêve encore
Ainsi demain déjà
Serai seul à nouveau
Et tu m'auras perdu
Rien qu'en me voulant trop
Tu m'auras gaspillé
À te vouloir bâtir
Un bonheur éternel
Ennuyeux à périr
Au lieu de te pencher
Vers moi tout simplement
Moi qui avais besoin
Si fort de ton printemps
Non les filles que l'on aime
Ne comprendront jamais
Qu'elles sont à chaque fois
Notre dernier muguet
Notre dernière chance
Notre dernier sursaut
Notre dernier départ
Notre dernier bateau

Dehors la nuit est noire
Dors ma mie bonsoir
Dors ma mie
C'est notre dernier soir

Jacques Brel,"Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Que l´amour soit son royaume
Et l´espoir son invité
Et qu´il soit pareil aux arbres
Que mon père avait plantés
Fiers et nobles comme soir d´été
Et que les rires d´enfants
Qui lui tintent dans la tête
L´éclaboussent de reflets de fête

Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Que son regard soit un psaume
Fait de soleils éclatés
Qu´il ne s´agenouille pas
Devant tout l´or d´un seigneur
Mais parfois pour cueillir une fleur
Et qu´il chasse de la main
A jamais et pour toujours
Les solutions qui seraient sans amour

Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Et qui ne soit pas un baume
Mais une force, une clarté
Et que sa colère soit juste
Jeune et belle comme l´orage
Qu´il ne soit jamais ni vieux ni sage
Et qu´il rechasse du temple
L´écrivain sans opinion
Marchand de riens
Marchand d´émotions

Pourvu que nous vienne un homme
Aux portes de la cité
Avant que les autres hommes
Qui vivent dans la cité
Humiliés, l´espoir meurtri
Et lourds de leur colère froide
Ne dressent au creux des nuits
De nouvelles barricades",L' Homme Dans la Cite,1958
Jacques Brel,"Quand Isabelle dort plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle dort au berceau de sa joie
Sais-tu qu'elle vole la coquine
Les oasis du Sahara
Les poissons dorés de la Chine
Et les jardins de l'Alhambra
Quand Isabelle dort plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle dort au berceau de sa joie
Elle vole les rêves et les jeux
D'une rose et d'un bouton d'or
Pour se les poser dans les yeux
Belle Isabelle quand elle dort

Quand Isabelle rit plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle rit au berceau de sa joie
Sais-tu qu'elle vole la cruelle
Le rire des cascades sauvages
Qui remplacent les escarcelles
Des rois qui n'ont pas d'équipages
Quand Isabelle rit plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle rit au berceau de sa joie
Elle vole les fenêtres de l'heure
Qui s'ouvrent sur le paradis
Pour se les poser dans le cœur
Belle Isabelle quand elle rit

Quand Isabelle chante plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle chante au berceau de sa joie
Sais-tu qu'elle vole la dentelle
Tissée au cœur de rossignol
Et les baisers que les ombrelles
Empêchent de prendre leur vol
Quand Isabelle chante plus rien ne bouge
Quand Isabelle chante au berceau de sa joie
Elle vole le velours et la soie
Qu'offre la guitare à l'infante
Pour se les poser dans la voix
Belle Isabelle quand elle chante",Isabelle,1958
Jacques Brel,"Je ne sais pas pourquoi la pluie
Quitte là-haut ses oripeaux
Que sont les lourds nuages gris
Pour se coucher sur nos coteaux
Je ne sais pas pourquoi le vent
S'amuse dans les matins clairs
A colporter les rires d'enfants
Carillons frêles de l'hiver
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas pourquoi la route
Qui me pousse vers la cité
A l'odeur fade des déroutes
De peuplier en peuplier
Je ne sais pas pourquoi le voile
Du brouillard glacé qui m'escorte
Me fait penser aux cathédrales
Où l'on prie pour les amours mortes
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas pourquoi la ville
M'ouvre ses remparts de faubourgs
Pour me laisser glisser fragile
Sous la pluie parmi ses amours
Je ne sais pas pourquoi ces gens
Pour mieux célébrer ma défaite
Pour mieux suivre l'enterrement
Ont le nez collé aux fenêtres
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas pourquoi ces rues
S'ouvrent devant moi une à une
Vierges et froides, froides et nues
Rien que mes pas et pas de lune
Je ne sais pas pourquoi la nuit
Jouant de moi comme guitare
M'a forcé à venir ici
Pour pleurer devant cette gare
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore

Je ne sais pas à quelle heure part
Ce triste train pour Amsterdam
Qu'un couple doit prendre ce soir
Un couple dont tu es la femme
Et je ne sais pas pour quel port
Part d'Amsterdam ce grand navire
Qui brise mon cœur et mon corps
Notre amour et mon avenir
Je ne sais rien de tout cela
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore
Mais je sais que je t'aime encore",Je Ne Sais Pas,1958
Jacques Brel,"Pour la rosée qui tremble au calice des fleurs
De n'être pas aimée et ressemble à ton cœur
Je t'aime
Pour le doigt de la pluie au clavecin de l'étang
Jouant page de lune et ressemble à ton chant
Je t'aime
Pour l'aube qui balance sur le fil d'horizon
Lumineuse et fragile et ressemble à ton front
Je t'aime

Pour l'aurore légère qu'un oiseau fait frémir
En la battant de l'aile et ressemble à ton rire
Je t'aime
Pour le jour qui se lève et dentelle le bois
Au point de la lumière et ressemble à ta joie
Je t'aime
Pour le jour qui revient d'une nuit sans amour
Et ressemble déjà, ressemble à ton retour
Je t'aime
Pour la porte qui s'ouvre, pour le cri qui jaillit
Ensemble de deux cœurs et ressemble à ce cri
Je t’aime
Je t’aime
Je t’aime",Je T'Aime,1958
Jacques Brel,"Mon cœur, ma mie, mon âme
Mon ciel, mon feu, ma flamme
Mon puits, ma source, mon val

Ma nuit, ma soif, ma faim
Mon jour, mon aube, mon pain

Jacques Brel,"La lumière jaillira
Claire et blanche un matin
Brusquement devant moi
Quelque part en chemin

La lumière jaillira
Et la reconnaîtrai
Pour l'avoir tant de fois
Chaque jour espérée

La lumière jaillira
Et de la voir si belle
Je connaîtrai pourquoi
J'avais tant besoin d'elle

La lumière jaillira
Et nous nous marierons
Pour n'être qu'un combat
N'être qu'une chanson

La lumière jaillira
Et je l'inviterai
A venir sous mon toit
Pour y tout transformer

La lumière jaillira
Et déjà modifié
Lui avouerai du doigt
Les meubles du passé

La lumière jaillira
Et j'aurai un palais
Tout ne change-t-il pas
Au soleil de juillet?

La lumière jaillira
Et toute ma maison
Assise au feu de bois
Apprendra ses chansons

La lumière jaillira
Parsemant mes silences
De sourires de joie
Qui meurent et recommencent

La lumière jaillira
Qu'éternel voyageur
Mon cœur en vain chercha
Mais qui était en mon cœur

La lumière jaillira
Reculant l'horizon
La lumière jaillira
Et portera ton nom

Et mon cœur et ton cœur
Sont repeints au vin blanc
Au printemps au printemps
Les amants vont prier
Notre-Dame du bon temps
Au printemps
Pour une fleur un sourire un serment
Pour l'ombre d'un regard en riant

Toutes les filles
Vous donneront leurs baisers
Puis tous leurs espoirs
Vois tous ces cœurs
Comme des artichauts
Qui s'effeuillent en battant
Pour s'offrir aux badauds
Vois tous ces cœurs
Comme de gentils mégots
Qui s'enflamment en riant

Se change en pâturage
Pour troupeaux d'amoureux
Aux bergères peu sages
Vois tout Paris
Joue la fête au village
Pour bénir au soleil
Ces nouveaux mariages

Au printemps au printemps
Et mon cœur et ton cœur
Sont repeints au vin blanc

Qui devait arriver
C'est la première chance
La seule de l'année

Jacques Brel,"Voici
Qu'un ciel penche ses nuages
Sur ces chemins d'Italie
Pour amoureux sans bagages
Voici

Des coteaux en ribambelles
Pour enrubanner nos vies
De vins clairs de fleurs nouvelles
Voici

Des cloches sonnant la fête
Des fêtes pour que l'on rie
Des rires que rien n'arrête
Voici

Des amours en robe blanche
Moitié fleur et moitié fruit
Que nous jalousent les anges
Voici

Des échos qui font la chaîne
Pur porter à l'infini
Nos ""toujours"" et nos ""je t'aime""
Voici
Des promesse de Saint-Jean
De Saint-Jean qui durent la vie
Des vies qu'épargne le temps
Voici

Certains sourires de nos pères
Que l'on recherche la nuit
Pour mieux calmer sa colère
Voici

Qu'au carrefour des amitiés
La douleur s'évanouit
Broyée par nos mains serrées
Voici

Qu'en nos faubourgs délavés
Des prêtres en litanies
Sont devenus ouvriers
Voici

Des mains ridées de courage
Qui caressent l'établi
D'où jaillit la belle ouvrage
Voici

Ces fleurs poussant en pagaille
Entre nous et l'ennemi
Pour empêcher la bataille
Voici",Voici,1958
Jacques Brel,"Bien sûr, nous eûmes des orages
Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol
Et chaque meuble se souvient
Dans cette chambre sans berceau
Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

Mais mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements
Tu m'as gardé de piège en piège
Je t'ai perdue de temps en temps
Bien sûr tu pris quelques amants
Il fallait bien passer le temps
Il faut bien que le corps exulte
Mais finalement, finalement
Il nous fallut bien du talent
Pour être vieux sans être adultes

Mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Et plus le temps nous fait cortège
Et plus le temps nous fait tourment
Mais n'est-ce pas le pire piège
Que vivre en paix pour des amants
Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt
Je me déchire un peu plus tard
Nous protégeons moins nos mystères
On laisse moins faire le hasard
On se méfie du fil de l'eau
Mais c'est toujours la tendre guerre

Oh, mon amour
Mon doux, mon tendre, mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime",La Chanson des Vieux Amants,1968
Jacques Brel,"Un enfant,
Ça vous décroche un rêve
Ça le porte à ses lèvres
Et ça part en chantant
Un enfant,
Avec un peu de chance
Ça entend le silence
Et ça pleure des diamants
Et ça rit à n'en savoir que faire
Et ça pleure en nous voyant pleurer
Ça s'endort de l'or sous les paupières
Et ça dort pour mieux nous faire rêver

Un enfant,
Ça écoute le merle
Qui dépose ses perles
Sur la portée du vent
Un enfant,
C'est le dernier poète
D'un monde qui s'entête
A vouloir devenir grand
Et ça demande si les nuages ont des ailes
Et ça s'inquiète d'une neige tombée
Et ça s’endort, de l’or sous les paupières
Et ça se doute qu'il n'y a plus de fées

Mais un enfant
Et nous fuyons l'enfance
Un enfant
Et nous voilà passants
Un enfant
Et nous voilà patience
Un enfant
Et nous voilà passés",Un Enfant,1968
