Hanson,"I see you shaking in your boots
Why won’t you put your petty fears aside
It’s time to get your dancing shoes
Well I’m about to show you why

I’ve got soul
And I’m not afraid to use it
You want more
I can show you how we do it
Don’t just stand, just stand still
Don’t just stand, just stand still
Don’t just stand, just stand still
Don’t just stand, ‘cause I, I got, I got soul

I’ve got a rhythm you can’t lose
If you let your body lead the way
It’s just a syncopated groove
It might be more than you can take

I’ve got soul
And I’m not afraid to use it
You want more
I can show you how we do it
Don’t just stand, just stand still
Don’t just stand, just stand still
Don’t just stand, just stand still
Don’t just stand, ‘cause I, I got, I got soul

I’ve got soul
And I’m not afraid to use it
You want more
Let me show you how we do it
‘Cause you know that I got soul",I've Got Soul,2013
Hanson,"Juliet, you’re my love I know it’s true
Around you I don’t know what to do
Can’t you see that you’re my sun and moon
Juliet, once upon a time is not enough
Don’t you know that I’m a man in love
And I can’t get enough of you

Your window breaks the rising sun
By any other name, you’re still so beautiful
In everything I do, I will love you my whole life
If you’ll be my, be my Juliet

Juliet, every single time you get me all messed up
I try to talk it out
But you’re so hot to touch
And Juliet, I feel so dangerous
Looking in your eyes is perilous
But I don’t care ‘cause I would die for love

Your window breaks the rising sun
By any other name, you’re still so beautiful
In everything I do, I will love you my whole life
If you’ll be my, be my

Juliet, you are a drug and it is quick
And with a kiss I lose my senses
Juliet, you are a fire, I am consumed
Tonight I’m dying in your arms

Through window breaks the rising sun
By any other name, you’re still so beautiful
In everything I do, I will love you my whole life
If you’ll be my, be my Juliet",Juliet,2013
Hanson,"I got a feeling that I cannot contain
I can't believe this moment
You've got your eyes locked on me
In my head I think it must be a mistake
But my heart says, take your chances
It could be this first dance is the “unexpected beautiful”
I can barely admit I've been longing for

Stay here in my arms tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I just wanna be the one you're holding onto
And if you wanna run tonight
I'd take you anywhere you want me to
I'm giving you my heart 'cause I
I'm lost without you
'Cause I'm lost without you

I see it all aligned in front of my face
But like a shooting star fades
It could be gone just as fast as it came
I'm gonna take this moment and chase this fear right out of me
Come one day
I will have no regrets after today
'Cause the “unexpected beautiful”
I'm about to admit I've been longing for

Is staying in my arms tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I just wanna be the one you're holding onto
And if you wanna run tonight
I'll follow anywhere you want me to
I'm giving you my heart 'cause I
I'm lost without you
Lost without you

Just stay here in my arms
Just stay here in my arms tonight

Stay here in my arms tonight
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I just wanna be the one you're holding onto
And if you wanna run tonight
I'd follow anywhere you want me to
I'm giving you my heart 'cause I
I'm lost without you
Lost without you

Hanson,"Amelia was always the one for me but she, she wouldn’t stay
And on a fine day, I came home to find that she had sailed away
Maybe I am broken, in some way I can say
‘Cause I don’t wanna change but lord knows that I need some help
Won’t you save me from myself

Cecilia with flowers in her hair was like the sun, she brought me the light
And I can’t tell you for the life of me why I would choose to let it burn it out
I wish I was numb, alone here in my cell
Something in my heart is making me not feel so well
Won’t you save me from myself

I get no sleep ‘cause I’m all alone
Like a living shadow where there once was bone
One cut deep and the other went sour
And no one’s to blame but I feel so shattered
Maybe I am lying still inside my shell
‘Cause I keep making waves and falling victim to the swell
Won’t you save me from myself",Save Me from Myself [Encore],2013
Hanson,"If I wait for summer to begin I may never begin myself
If we look to another for our dreams they may never become our own
There’s a story every girl will share and a journey every boy must take
Sing it if you know it
Scream it if you feel it
There’s nothing standing in your way
Follow along with me
Scream and be free

If you’re always living for tomorrow you’re gonna miss right now
If we’re only looking in the mirror we’ll never see ourselves
There’s a story every girl will share and a journey every boy must take
Sing it if you know it
Scream it if you feel it
There’s nothing standing in your way
Follow along with me
Scream and be free

Scream and be free

Raise your voices
Singing one more song
We will not be here for too long
Raise your voices
Singing my anthem
Make your mark before we’re un-dead

You’ve got to scream it out

Sing it if you know it
Scream it if you feel it
There’s nothing standing in your way
Follow along with me
Scream and be free

You’ve got to scream and be free

If I wait for summer to begin I may never begin",Scream and Be Free,2013
Hanson,"Tonight is the first night
Tonight is the last night
Don’t care what has come before
Tomorrow’s an open door
So box to the ropes and jump in the crowd
Throw up your hands and sing it out loud
Oh, tonight

Well it might be a shame and you might be disheartened
To be back on the rocks this time around
I’ve seen the sunshine and I’ve seen the rain
When you walk the line brilliance can sound insane

But tonight is the first night
Tonight is the last night
Don’t care what has come before
Tomorrow’s an open door
So box to the ropes and jump in the crowd
Throw up your hands and sing it out loud

And say what you mean and mean what you say
And tonight
Chase down the dream and don’t give up without a fight
And don’t wait for tomorrow’s daylight
'Cause it just might be tonight

When you’re too tired to walk and too scared to run
And your heavyweight knees buckle under a ton
Blue sky visions turn into a storm
I’ve got suspicions you won’t make it one more
Well there’s no silver lining, there’s nothing to lose
So don’t wait for tomorrow
Don’t wait for tomorrow

'Cause tonight is the first night
Tonight is the last night
Don’t care what has come before
Tomorrow’s an open door
So box to the ropes and jump in the crowd
Throw up your hands and sing it out loud

Hanson,"Out on the corner on your soapbox looking down
Waving your flag like this is a battle ground
Your fancy words try to cut me down to size
Hey mister, mister, you’re in for a big surprise

You can't stop us
You can't stop us now

Soldier of fortune tried to shoot me down
Beating his chest only to hear the sound
Pumping his fist saying that our cause is dead
Go put your lies in somebody else's head

You can't stop us
You can't stop us
You can't stop us now

You can't stop us
You can't

You say you’re teaching wrong from right
I say you’re preaching only to start a fight

This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate spaghetti Os, played laser tag and GI Joe's
And if you vowed no girls allowed then you could join the club
When I was I was a kid I spent my Saturday's
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King and I could feel the love

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees and Dr Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of Jurassic Park was how real the Raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS,
Watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, Zack Morrison
The first cell phone, it was off the hook!

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

Cat, pogs, and floam and home alone, Berenstein bears and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-sketch
What happens next?
Grape juicy juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip-n-slides, McDonalds Fries, those were the best
What happens next?

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

He said I am reaching for the sky

People don't belong in clouds or space
It's just an empty quest for ego's sake

'Cause I have to see how high it goes

While others, they won't even try
I'll be reaching for the sky

Do the stars shine brighter there?
Can you really walk on air?

If other men have touched the moon
Then Saturn's rings could be mine soon

Nachts ist es gefährlich draußen
Viele schlimme Dinge geschehen
Dunkle Gestalten sind unterwegs
Kleine Kinder sollten zu Hause bleiben

Ich bin nachts unterwegs wie ein Vampir und jage durch die Stadt
Vollbeladen mit allen Farben, fahre mit dem Gras
Grün, braun, weiß habe ich parat
Wenn du Bargeld hast, dann ruf einfach an
Ich bin aktiv auf Nachtschicht unter der Brücke
Hunnis in Bündel machen unsereins glücklich

Wiegen auf Waage gerade Gs von dem Haze
Die Straßen sind bitter, kalt ab Mitternacht

Ott bunkern, bevor die Cops dein Kopf noch in 'nem Loch bunkern

Yeah I'm thinking 'cause deep in I'm sinking
I'm looking at death and I ain't even blinkin'
Smoking and drinking, partying hard
I'm around all these devils, but my body is gone
My spirit is good, but my mind is fucked

Kommt es hundertfach vor, dass ein Traum einfach zerbricht
So viele Pläne, noch mehr Probleme
Nichts machte mir mehr Freude, als gegen dich zu treten

Immer ich nur konnte war ich ganze zeit am zocken(Ja man!)
Und dank der bösen linken Klebe
Siehst du öfters den Ball im Winkel kleben
Jedes Wochenende war die Vorfreunde riesig, denn 
Tore zu schießen war meine erste große Liebe
Ich werd' dich immer wieder kriegen (immer)
Egal in welchem Garten du auch fliegst
Unter welchem Auto du auch liegst, ich brauche doch nur dich!
Und bleib diszipliniert, denn ein Raucher schafft es nicht
Du brauchst tausendfachen biss (ja man!)
Um zu schaffen was du schaffen willst
Denn da draußen gibt es Kids die nicht anders haben in ihr'm Leben
Alles Geben, um irgendwann als Profi gegen den Ball zu tretten (ja man!)
Du solltest bald verstehen, von nichts, kommt nichts

Du willst immer mehr, gehst kaputt, immer mehr
Immer mehr, immer mehr, amina
Du wirst taub und blind, lebst für den Augenblick

Du wirst zum Zombie, Spitzname Staubsauger
Bis zum Tag, wo dir einer sagt man kann's auch rauchen

Sabber fließt durch deinen Mund, du kommst dir wie 'n Krüppel vor
Liegst da mit Schüttelfrost, der Entzug ist der Grund
Dir fällt das Atmen schwer, du sagst, du siehst Dämonen
Läufst oben ohne und siehst außer Panik gar nichts mehr
Warum du hier bist liegt an deiner Gier
Noch 'ne Line hier, noch 'ne Line hier
Statt dicke Möbel hast du nur noch ein Bett
Nur noch einen Stuhl, Tisch und der Rest ist weg
Statt Parties gibt's Gruppentherapie

Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, back 'til you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop

Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
'Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
'Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch

Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'

You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you lie, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch

I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So at your court hearin', judge show me some leniency
Can't escape old havoc, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your car seat, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up

What up, Street?
Yo, what up, man?
We gon' put some ""Welcome to the meth lab"" on there

Cowards in their face when they scheming I bet cash

The tool gonna spray
I suggest you stay in your lane

I saw the best minds of my generation running on empty, Superglued to the T.V.,
Dreaming of prosperity, Talking incessantly, Saying nothing
Sleeping on platforms at train stations, Sipping chemical cocktails,
Alive to the Universe, Dead to the World.
Hallucinating delusions of media reality in Camden Town, Desperate in the pursuit of cool
He's in a suit, she's in a straight jacket, 7-11 nightmares at 3am and the moon is quiet and holy.
Watch all the bridges collide, Well I think we might have to lay low, for a while
I saw the best minds of my generation caught up in the virtual reality of living
Memorizing pin numbers and secret codes,
Swaying robotically to non-existent rhythms, Flashing memberships to clubs so exclusive nobody belongs,

Scared shitless, witless, clueless, useless, tightlipped, tightfisted,tightassed, half-assed
Sniveling, groveling, moaning, groaning Sniveling, groveling, moaning, groaning sniveling, groveling, sniveling, groveling

If you lay in the street you can hear it humming, Building up slowly from underground
If you close your eyes you can observe the blueprint The man-made dna that spirals breathlessly out of control,
As synapses collapse, bridges snap, into a restless utopia, Nutopia

I like getting dressed when I can choose.
If one sock is white and red,
And one is blue instead,

And when I wear orange pants with my green cap,

If your mother says don't chew it,

Can you catch it on your tonsils,
Can you heave it left & right?

To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?

Or should I say she once had me

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.

Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

That makes me change so suddenly
From looking out to feeling free?

Wondering what it was I said
That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure

Happy Feet Two Chorus,"Just when you think
Hope is lost
And giving up
Is all you got,
Blue turns black,
Your confidence is cracked,
There seems no turning back from here

Sometimes there isn't an obvious explanation
Why the holiest hearts can feel the strongest palpitations

That's when you can build a bridge of light,
That's what turns the wrongs all right
That's when you can't give up the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day,
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's why you gotta be strong tonight,
Only love can build us a bridge of light

When your feet are made of stone
You're convinced that you're all alone
Look at the stars instead of the dark
You'll find your heart shines like the sun

Let's not let our anger get us lost
And the need to be right comes at way too high a cost

That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrongs all right
That's when you know it's worth the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's why you gotta be strong tonight
'Cause only love can build us a bridge of light

Deep breath, take it on the chin
But don't forget to let love back in

And as I, tell myself, I'm a changed man
Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical
Hella cold, I'm a gonna be off in hell old

And stay wicked, and plus we keep it explicit
Abducted by the streets see it's hard to manage

Shorts, t-shirts on caps, and we gone drink
Till my people collapse, so line em up
To the end of the bar, I ain't playing slick
Here go a couple of dollars so keep em coming quick
And say what's up ma', she said what's up though
I seen it in her face that the broad was a cut throat
And she's a hustla, she like to stack her chips
And break bread with the click and roll the fancy whips
She told me, ain't nothing fin to stop our shine
And we ain't sipping cristal we sip the rolly with lime

She dance the cumbias
She dance meringue
And she shaking it like she want it, want it

Looking so famous she's training in hot rock
Dirty dancing drop tops, keeping it on pop
Doing them crunk dances, licking a loli-pop
She make it bang like bazookas, she's sweeter than my asuka
Hmm, mami chula nobody gone do it cooler
Crimination is passion, she smoke a sweet while she dancing

She got the real McCoy, now she gone fill your boy
So I'ma feel devoy with some of that thrill and joy
Now Baby Bash you a fool, sipping a margarita
Baby you know I want you but I really don't need you

Y'all soldiers know my truth be ill
Now with these visions and these bad thoughts
Runnin' through my mind
Stop the clock, see I'm runnin' out of time
And as I, tell myself, I'm a changed man
Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical
Hella cold, I'm a gonna be off in hell old

Plus it's hard to focus, when you crooked and hopeless
I ain't home, but my mama don't notice
Nationwide with thugs, locked out it's just us
With the Feds and the police out to bust us
The most prominent, see we stay dominate
And stay wicked, and plus we keep it explicit
Abducted by the streets see it's hard to manage
End up on my block saying we the savage

So you made a little money, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you roll on 24's, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you pimped a few hoes, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you earned a few stripes, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?

I hear you rappin' 'bout the streets, talkin' bout pushin' deal
When most of y'all never seen a triple beam scale
Runnin' from weed smell, runnin' from dank smoke
Then you get on the mic, talkin' bout you been chokin'
Ya lame as mark, buy some heart with your chump change
Don't make me start, cold hearted droppin' punk names
You run thangs? Maybe, in your back yard
You act hard round here you gonna get smacked hard

Baby bash cross game, that's a negative
With savage dreams on my mind so repetative
Let it live, let it go, player do or die
'Cause fools on my side will tell the other fool to ride
Down to do what I gotta do, to satisfy the man in me
I pull illicit things, my family ain't understandin' me
So while I have kids beatin' up on the door
I'm gonna crack up and smoke with a corona

So you got a platinum grill, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you got a record deal, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
So you pack a few gats, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?
You fell in love with your bitch, oh wow
What the fuck your punk ass finna do now?

The day I wake up, blaze up, lace my J's up
Try to make a couple stacks for' the days up
Hustle hard nigga, that's how I live
Only fuckin' with fans, my niggas and relatives
And I dress fly, all clean and keep a fat knot
For supplying all the beats to the have nots

HP you ain't knowin' I run this, so stop braggin'
Won't kill what you don't bitch or watch your grill hoe
I'll have you iced out, you beat grills
With your motherfuckin' lights out

Get off them pills and come back to reality

I'm going crazy, crazy for you
And have you ever loved somebody that would give it all for you
I'm going crazy, crazy for you

Lived life by myself
Never cared for solitude
Just cared for the wealth
Steady stackin'
Never slackin'
With no time to be wastin'

I was chasin' their paper
But then (but then) came you (came you)
And it was over baby 
I was going crazy for you
And I ain't felt this way in a minute
And I ain't gonna lie to you ma

Trade my world and I'd give my life

And every day you make it clear that you don't want to be replaced
Just by them little things you do, just by them little things you say

From court dates to miscarriages to you losing your mama
But now (but now) I see (I see)
That you're my one and only
Baby oh I'm going crazy
I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more
It's like I toss and turn at night 
Memories ease my pain
I keep hearing you laughin', screamin', callin' my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

[Chorus]

My only sanity in these walls
Is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind

I've loved all I've needed to love

Strung out in heaven's high

Time and again I tell myself 
I'll stay clean tonight 
But the little green wheels are following me 
Oh no, not again 
I'm stuck with a valuable friend 
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""

I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh

Driving on the wrong side of my English heart

I had a dream of a brand-new start

Phone lines lie across the Atlantic
I guess it's time to fly trans-romantic

Are you lonesome baby USA?
I heard you cry 3000 miles away
Go west young man you said, I was on my way
Don't shoot, I love you baby USA

The pages turned, I stayed put
Now like a pilgrim on Plymouth sound
I'm America bound, hand and foot

A continental drift in my direction

A fifty-floor building points to all things heavenly
Down at the roofs of high anxiety

Happyland,"Another dumb radio song
Let's turn it up and all sing along.
You can't be sure but you've heard it before
So soft and light just six major chords.

Guaranteed to make a visible difference.
Fortified with purifying tones.
Adding volume while retaining highlights.
It works like a dream.

It's softly contemporary,
Glides on so it's light and creamy,
Skins smooth without feeling greasy,
Your hairs looking soft and dreamy.

I love a dumb radio song,
Firms up the thighs while you hum along.
Kind to sensitive skin
They'll never know that you're wearing it.

Guaranteed to keep the moisture surging.
Fortified with rabbit fetal gel.
Stay fast color for the binge and purging.
It's just like a dream.

It's softly contemporary,
Glides on so it's light and airy,
Skins smooth without feeling greasy,
Your hairs looking soft and dreamy.

You've got wings for every party,
Shaped to fit your natural form.
Now comes with an applicator.

It's hip and it's now and funky.
It's pop but a little punky.

And swim around with my family.
The waters cool and so are we.
Our bodies soft and rubbery.

Back to the place I held so dear.

Back to the form I once was.

I want to go back to the sea
And swim around with my family.
The waters cool and so are we.
Our bodies soft and rubbery.

And turn my head not once to see

And she gave it to me on the mixin' board

Finished up with a lick I'm out in record time
Jumped in the hoopty, put it in drive

Whoops!
I forgot it's smokin' time
4-2-0 so the spliff did light

My watery eyes spied a traffic jam
The carpool lane was my only chance
Flew by the ass of my pants
But I couldnt see the trap at the top of that ramp

Whoop, Whoop
The sirens did blow
Cops caught me cheatin' on ninety-fohh
I know there's only two ways these things can go
One for Har Mar and one for Po Po

Smiled in delight as she reached my front door
This lady cop knows not what she's in for
I lead her eyes to the bulge in my pants
Let her get a glimpse of the holy land
She tried to hold her emotions back
But when I licked my lips she had no chance

I said
Beep beep
I'm all up in your grill
Just to let you know how my body feel
I need a piece of what your panties conceal
I want to get caught and give you this thrill

She threw me in to the back of her squad
Hand cuffed me up to each side of her bra
She said (escape)
And I ripped it off
When we started grindin' she 'bout lifted off
Any mess I made I licked it off
So she kissed my ticket and she ripped it up

When I got home I loved what I found
My girl was masturbating to the Har Mar sound
My baby gets off when I get around
So I told her everything and turned the lights down.

When you come home at night,
And you had a little too much to drink,
This is one thing,
We all guilty!

Sittin' alone in my room at home,
Girl come on pick up the phone,
Keep the spot next to ya warm,
I know I got my own ringtone.

I made 'bout a million DUI's,
That's how I always win the prize.
All the times I get to night,
There's a hot little baby by my side.
D! Is the dial your fingers dance.
Give it to me!
You! Under the spell of romance,
Can you let me get
I! Is the dangerous influence,
I feel it!
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!
I'm the lonely man,
With a roaming climb.

I'm resisting the urge and turning on the telly,
Baby don't you have something to tell me?
It's 4 AM my brain has turned to jelly,
Come on baby hope you got the semi,
How long is this dong girl this cannot be healthy,
I'm so wet I have to get my wellies,
Whenever you're near you never get this filthy,
It's because I'm greeting and your wealthy.

Tip on the cotton candy bus,
I win a soft tiger just for us.
These are the broken promices,
That I won't recall when the sun comes up.

Everybody got a Dj night,
Rocking the chance for all their friends to climb,
When it comes to closing time,
Who you gonna crush with a drunken dial?

Har Mar Superstar,"You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you

Harajuku,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Harajuku,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
What all this fightings for
From a distance there is harmony 
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
This is the song for every man

Harald Banter,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Harald Banter,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2007
Harald Bergersen,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
Harald Heide-Steen Jr.,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Harald Juhnke,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,1993
Harald Juhnke,"Strangers in the night, exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
And ever since that night, we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night",Strassen von Berlin,1998

I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Harbor Lights,"Give me a disaster,
Give me emergency,
Stand me at the head of the     crusades without a remedy.

Show me to the shipwreck,
show me how your bones shake,
And when I'm at the edge of sorrow's blade,
show me how a heart breaks.

Be steady on your feet,
No matter the trouble you meet

Lions make you brave,
Giants give you faith,
Death is a charade.
You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid.

Find me at the bottom,
looking at the vultures.
Standing in the heart of the disease,
following the hard curves.

I'm looking for the thunder,
I'm looking for the blackness.
I'm learning how to get up off my knees,
and all it takes is practice.

Be ready on your feet,
No matter what trouble you meet.

Lions make you brave,
Giants give you faith,
Death is a charade.
You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid.

I'm not the hunter,
I'm not the marked.
Just looking for wisdom in the dark

She'd hold me close and kiss me but her heart was full of lies

She left me with a broken heart and won her victory
