Johnny Mathis,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, What a world, what a life, I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so
If I should ever let her go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life
Oh, what a world, what life
What a world, what life, cause I'm in love
[He's in love, he's in love]
I'm in love
[Got the world on a string]
And what a wonderful thing
[Alright]
When you get the world on a string
[Uh huh]",I've Got The World On A String,2000
Johnny Mathis,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",Like Someone In Love,2000
Johnny Mathis,"O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!
How are thy leaves so verdant!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How are thy leaves so verdant!

Not only in the summertime,
But even in winter is thy prime.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
How are thy leaves so verdant!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!

For every year the Christmas tree,
Brings to us all both joy and glee.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Much pleasure doth thou bring me!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!

Each bough doth hold its tiny light,
That makes each toy to sparkle bright.
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
Thy candles shine out brightly!",O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree) (German),2001
Johnny Mathis,"My love
I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
You taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you make me feel brand new

My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that's sometimes back

Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me?

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you, yes

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you
You make me feel brand new

For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you",You Make Me Feel Brand New,2001
Johnny Mathis,"Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in, day out",Day in Day Out,2001
Johnny Mathis,"If I could I'd like to be, a great big movie star
Overnight sensation, drive a big expensive car
I would buy you everything your little heart desires
These things I do, 'cause I'm stone in love with you

(Stone in love with you)

If I were a business man, I'd sit behind a desk
I'd be so successful, I would scare wall street to death
I would hold a meeting for the press to let them know
I did it all, 'cause I'm stone in love with you

(Stone in love with you)

I'm just a man, an average man
Doing everything the best I can
But if I could, I'd give the world to you

I'd like to someday be the owner of 
The first house on the moon
There would be no neighbors, and no population boom
You might say that all I do is dream my life away

I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love for you
I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love with you
I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love for you",I'm Stone in Love with You,2002
Johnny Mathis,"I'm gonna laugh you right out of my life
Laugh, and forget this affair
Guess I was foolish
To care

So I'm gonna dance you right out of my dreams
Try to be carefree and gay
I guess I'll learn to play
The part

Cause when our friends begin that
Heartless rumor
I know I'll really need my
Sense of humor

I'm gonna laugh you right out of my life
Make it a beautiful joke
No one will know you broke
My heart

But if I find you and I
Really meant that last goodbye
Then I'm gonna laugh so hard
I'll cry

But if I find you and I
Really meant that last goodbye
Then I'm gonna laugh so hard
I'll cry",I'm Gonna Laugh You out of My Life,2002
Johnny Mathis,"I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon

Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face

I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face [From My Fair Lady],2003
Johnny Mathis,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.

Johnny Mathis,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Johnny Mathis,"My funny valentine
Sweet, comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet your my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak,
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine
Stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?

Each day is Valentine's Day",My Funny Valentine [From Babes in Arms],2003
Johnny Mathis,"Where do I begin,
To tell the story of how great a love can be?
The sweet love story that is older than the sea.
The simple truth about the love she brings to me.
Where do I start?

With her first hello!
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine.
There'd never be another love, another time.
She came into my life and made the living fine.
She fills my heart 

She fills my heart with very special things,
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings.
She fills my soul with so much love,
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely.
With her along, who could be lonely?
I reach for her hand, it's always there 

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say,
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there 
She'll be there",Where Do I Begin [From Love Story],2003

Johnny Mathis,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Johnny Mathis,"Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare
Then your lips cling to mine
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky
I turn to you and you melt in my arms
There we are, darling, only you and I
What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is full of wondrous things it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet evening I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love
I'm aware of the treasure that I own
And I say to myself
It's wonderful, wonderful

Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind

Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind

You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, and with your kiss the world begins
You're Spring to me, all things to me
You're life itself

Happy, happy snowman
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty, the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have
Some fun down before I melt away""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets
Of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

And the beauty of it all
When the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you some time
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted waters's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not to those who wait too late
We got to go for all we know

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building big castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us, you and I

Just the two of us, we can make it
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building big castles in the sky

And every crazy day brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand,

And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a newborn king today
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
They saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from Heaven's way, the music came from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary, came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight

Hark I hear the angels sing, a new king born today
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day

By and by they find a little nook in a stable all forlorn

My love, to tell you how I feel
My love, mere words could not explain

Precious love, you held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
You taught me how to live again

Only you cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

God bless you, you make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you make me feel brand new

My love, whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend, with you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that's sometimes back

Without you, my life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me?

God bless you , you make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
And you make me feel brand new

That I never had a girl to love.
Many a fine girl I tried hard to know,
But I think I never tried enough.

Sitting one day by myself,
And I'm thinking, ""What could be wrong?""
When this funny little Hedgehog comes running up to me,
And it starts up to sing me this song.

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes,
That you never quite learned the song.

Every day when the sun go down,
And the evening is so very still,
Many a fine girl I've held in my arms,
And I hope there's many more that I will,
But just when everything is going fine,
And absolutely nothing is wrong,
This funny little Hedgehog's always around
And every time he wants to sing me this song.

But you never quite learned the song, she sang.

Found myself a pretty little girl,
And I stopped all my running around;

And he's just gonna pop on the ring,

Running down the aisle,
And I don't have to tell you what he did sing.

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes,
But you never quite learned the song, she sang.

And it isn't just me I got to please,

Who's always around,
And the only words he ever sings to me are these.

Johnny Mercer,"I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental
She saw me and I saw she
Had a manner too bold and much too free
Her eyes were positively detrimental
When I asked about this gay coquette
I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

Which, of course, he doesn't deservish

I adore this ?

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show

And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out

Queenie, someday you'll fall

In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed

jingle all the way!

I thought I'd take a ride,

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Go it while you're young,

As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?

Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.

And disappeared into the infinite,

Johnny Mercer,"Tangerine,
She is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine,
When she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen
Toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine,
She is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache.
Tangerine,
With her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame.
And I've seen
Clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says ""From Macy's Mezzanine"".
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl
But she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine!",Tangerine,1996

With some spring daisies on it,
Even birds of a feather show their clothes off together.

Gazes down across his eagle beak

Johnny Mercer,"I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

You take romance. I'll take jello.
You calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean.
At least they flap their fins to express emotion.
A fine romance, with no quarrels,
With no insults, and all the morals.
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France.
I never get the chance.
This is a fine romance.

A fine romance, with no kisses.
A fine romance, my friend, this is.
True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has.
We don't have half the thrills that ""The March of Time"" has.
A fine romance, with no clinches.
A fine romance, with no pinches.
You never give the orchids I send a glance.
No, you like cactus plants.
This is a fine romance.",A Fine Romance [Duet],2000

My mama done told me, she said Son
A woman will sweet-talk ya, she'll give you the big eye
But when that sweet talkin' is done

A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Now the rain's a fallin', hear the train a callin', oooo-ee
Hear the lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, oooo-ee

Oooo-ee-a-oooo-ee, ol' clickety-clack
Comes echoing back the blues in the night
The evening breeze will start the trees to cryin'
And the moonlight will hide its light

When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird
He will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong and he's right

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds seem to blow
I've been in some big towns and I've heard me some big talkin'

But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face
She's a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

Got a case of the blues in the night
Don't know what to do
Blues every night
It's all because of you

But I don't know why
Cause I'm sticky a city loving guy
Just sitting there when a little bird flies my way
Hello bee

I looks at him and he's lookin' at me
We're both satisfying our curiosity
Who can this be?
Quick like a rabbit I gets me a ?
So I ups to him and I say,
Whatcha say?
""Oh Mister Meadowlark we gots a lot of serenading to do.""
Who to?
""Ooh Mister Meadowlark I'm just a city slicker & I'm counting on you.""

Now if you should cop a gander when I'm kissing my chick
Needless to remind I'm gonna have the decency to exit due but quick
Say but what if Mrs. M thinks I'm out stepping?
Fear not, I'll make it alright
For Mr. Meadowlark meet me in the dark tonight
The scene changes, nightfall, our two characters at the ? place, the park,
Spoon and spark with meadowlark

Ooh Mister Meadowlark we're gathered here to witness this moment event
It's a charming little park
Paid for by the city
Now my brother you're a cinch
Cause when I send them, they're sent
You mean you're ready?
Suppose I hit a real good ripple
Well whistle me a whizzer
I'll slip you a ?
Now when I begin
Why that's where I come in
Pretty now
Oh Mister Meadowlark, I guess you know that clinker put the finish oh me
Fair weather friend, eh?
Needn't to remind I hope you know you put me in a practically impossible key

A good day from morning' till night

and it's a good day for losing the blues;

Anchor outside the school door

A couple of kids once more 

School days, school days 
Dear old golden rule days 
Readin' and 'ritin' and 'rithmetic

I was your bashful barefoot beau 
And you wrote on my slate, ""I love you, Joe""

And the oak tree that grew on its brow 
They've built forty storeys upon that old hill 
And the oak's an old chestnut now

So fragrant with clover and maize 
Into new city lots and preferred bus'ness plots 
They've cut them up since those days

My father will be pacin' the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)

My brother will be there at the door (waves upon a tropical shore)

Say lend me a coat (it's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!

I thought I'd take a ride,

But quickly drove away.

Is a little college

Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'

(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Johnny Nash,"Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love

Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about
A little word like love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I think god that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

The moon was new and so was love

You came at last, love had its day

Johnny Neel,"Bigelow the gigolo had no where else to go
His sad eyes had seen it all
Scarred and lonely, tough as nails
Open your heart when all else fails
Wear the veil and the trojan horse smile

Looking back on yesteryear
Seems like, maybe, you missed your calling
But hindsight is very clear when loneliness is falling

And you have fallen down, down from the heavens
Stuck out in the desert
Amazing grace, such a lonely place 
For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by
To carry you away

Target practice with other people's lives
Hit a few right between the eyes
But, most of the time, you were wounded by the ricochet
You say Ã¢??play to win, boys, never play to lose
Long as your playing, boy, you're bullet-proofÃ¢??
But think about it, you're bleeding to death anyway

And you have fallen down, down from the heavens

Amazing grace, such a lonely place 
For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by

Angel of mercy, take pity on a fool
That spent a lifetime wondering 
What Napoleon would do
If he were in your shoes

Rich, without pleasure, respected without love
Drinking poison from a golden cup
While anger, brother of fear, creeps like a knife into your heart

And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say

I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry

I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you

I seen into the future, you and I true blue, huh
High school, eleventh grad, my-my you fly
I was struck, you gave a go, we took it slow
Every Friday you mad it my day, comin to know
You was pure inside out, and not just a ho
Oh my god, my folks takin to you, now it's official
If other girls would call the crib, my mommy she would blow the whistle
I'ma, past the fatuation love is in effect, now
What you call sex, I say 'yo baby I'm stressed out'
We hooked a bond that's so strong knowin

We get a crib together, our love is tough as leather
Always by your side like a shadow, but not narrow

Handle each other with care, we're
Inseperable, none come second to you
We imbelish in trust, we might fuss and cuss
Cause we're like stainless steel baby, we can never rust
Blessed with God, for grantin my soulmate to life

Do what you want, I don't worry bout fools
Cause I know know it's me you're comin home to, true

So much temptation but I don't pickup strays
Case in fact, I'd rather be many a groupies
Lookin fine like I realized they just floosies
Toured the world from Amsterdam to Japan
Shot at me on tour, hooker tried to play a man, now
Thought about my girl, my moms and my pops
If it wasn't for the cops I'd be layin in a box
Dyin in vain, causin whole lotta pain
Tombstone mighta read 'Gave it what all for the fame'
And when I'm away call my woman every day
I figure why fuck up a good thing over one night's lay, I say
Gettin past all the sour times we had
From others intervening talkin nothing but trash, but
We got a bond that's so strong knowin

Floatin the stage, I'm movin like a black Fred Astaire - smooth
The momentum of the bass and treble, levels on point
Bonus to ride, the microphone
it's O.C. slash, Mush shine communicatin for the masses

Not for you to follow it but try and stand clear, bust it

Bein wild as hell, means you a smart motherfucker WRONG

Most rappers gunsprayed or hustled from night to day - fiction
I deciphered lots of rhymes, only to find
false info, just to see what it meant to Oh

That's why the seed was born to lead assume
positions like Noah, all aboard the arc with

Back in the mix of things to break the mold
Good as gold mind ya leave negative thoughts behind ya

Move with the mystique of a cheetah, mysterious
Dominate jungles when I walk the floor rumbles
The baddest motherfuckers - I make their attitudes humble
My aura shine bright like sunlight, in Farenheight temperature

Most is type of scriptures, follow me is for reference
Other MC's make no kind of sense
Oh freeze foes and bleed souls and leave those stunned
Descended on the planet, you're in confusion
Pick ten, subtract five then, subtract four
Watch the Sun leave a shadow on the man that's raw

Chorus: repeat 2X

The Chosen One",The Chosen One,1997
Johnny O.C.,"Check out the scheme of a dream, thick fog all around me
Standing in a tunnel of blood, hounds surround me
Shadow of a child, my eyes visualize and figure
And as you walked backwards the shadow grew bigger
Temptation made me curios to follow it
All fear in my heart, at that point I done swallowed it
State like trance as I reach out my hand
You wore an overcoat robe, face was disclosed
Now was this a dream or reality
I was about to become one of Satan's fuckin fatalities
In silence, I hear the wings of a black crow flappin
The bird lands, then appears a man
Very sleek in physique, stood  about six feet
Dispute was jet black I had to step back
His dimeanor wasn't pure, I knew this for sure
He had a diseased look that the world couldn't cure
I'm forzen, the fear returned to my body
Heart pumpin so fast, I thought I was goin into cardiac arrest
I wake up in a cold sweat, wifey sleepin on my left sound asleep
I peep around the room then I make a sudden jest
A feather from a black crow was beside my pillow
Was it a sign from God to repute for the things that I did in my lifetime
Now my soul's on the line
I'm puzzled, spark up a Newport
Then I take a fall in hell it's the cancer
Then I try and find an answer

CHORUS: (2x)

My wisdom that I'm droppin is-
Is somethin like a doctor and
Necessary like oxygen
I'm seein who's my opposite
And who's my aid in life
So let's attract and repell
Third rate government they tryin to seize the world

Day like a rose, the wind is blowin hard against the window
Pull up the blinds there sits the crow
I back up fast heart beatin massive
Lost my breath, collapsin fallin on the mattress
I went into a state of unconsciousness
Open my eyes up, I'm layin on the dark street
Leaves blowin in the breezes, Jesus
I on the street like a nightmare
I take flight, a bird through the air
While I'm wingin it I see all sorts of chaos
Dead bodies, burned buildings turned over cars
Uh-uh, seein visions of an all out war
Territory factors, picture escape from New York
Gun fire, blomb flowin, nerve gas a-flowin
Just imagine whole race of Harlem gaurds showin
Realizin I was havin out-of-body experience
Return to my physical and wake up tense
Layin in the hospital as I figured the riddle
G-O-D was throwin at me paranormally so
Givin sight beyond sight about the world we know
A preminition that I saw through the eyes of a pro",The Crow,1997

Oh yeah,  baby far from yours, oh yeah 

Yo  time is most limited I'm back on the scene 
O replenishes  potency like four or five Guinnesses 
Hennessey's flourishing  O.C.is nourishing 
Performin miracles  ill and mad lyrical 
What stands before your very eyes is a 
One man stand alone phenomenon 
Microphone misery you sufferin  taste my repetoire 
In your face like a buck fifty, done with the razor 
I'm felt by Aztecs, felt by Asians 
Portuguese Lebanese and even Caucasians 
Every form of power, they respect my stats 
Slap me five, with former leader drink Cognac with diplomat 
Retard your whole brigade, cave in your brain waves

Ya hit reverse to rewind, and defy my cause

He's no average M.C., with a smile on his face 
Though they'll try to bite his style, no one can duplicate 

I be the chosen one, beyond the Moet and Cristal 
A son of King and a Queen, therefore ability 
For song run in my genetics 
I gave ideas to L. Ron Hubbard to write books on Dianetics 
FedEx your info, if you want to show the manager 
Mr. Dave make sure give us a good payday too 
I was assigned to Earth, on a mission 
To spread worldwide my glorious compositions 
Notes are like be	 sharps floatin 
Out of my mouth from start to finish til the song diminish 
My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's 
Who listen to O, he didn't know me before 
Then you know who I are now, bitin my style 
That's a crime to be dealth with but we take it to trial 
Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause 
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours"" 

[Chorus]

He's no average MC, with a smile on his face 
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate 
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say 
And he's never ever ever too far, from tomorrow, today 

[Chorus]

You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony 
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy 
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery 
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity 
My identity, will ring bells in all facilities 
From fans to enemies I'm the antidote and remedy 
I'ma philosophize, analyze, no question 
If I die I'ma return like Jesus' resurrection 
I'm a blessin to the rap game, my claim to fame is when 
I disappear reappear, I put rappers to shame 
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish 
The meanest lyric flamethrower your career's over 
Finesse a mic Casanova, Don Juan or MC 
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged 
Yo Raider, flip the fader, let em know my cause 
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

Yea
Yo, flaws and fallacies of life
Material items and shit
Beware motherfuckers
Word up, don't let it getcha, you know?
This shit ain't nothing
One time, check him out

Yo, you live the life of a hustle 
Not sympathetic to a user
Making cats fast taking trips to Bermuda
Elegant women, all lovely and feminine 
Houses with arces, and big pools for swimming in
Big transactions, swiping all the action
Driving a Benz and Lex, you be like maxing
Jewels be on truck shit
Rims with fat clusters
Diamonds on your teeth, shining shimmers and lusterous
And God's hanging sideways, holding your head high
Cruising through a block, so you past a dreads
Now the dreads are looking hard at your face Mr. Fly Guy
Unaware tonight their gonna do a fucking drive by
Go home watch a sci-fi flick, with a chick, till
10pm, now it's time for you to dip
Go round up a few men hold a classified
Info inside, hand picked these nigga's you confided in the shippment
To pick up quick, click off Clyde's
Seven numbers for you if their gonna demise 
A scheme of betrayal
Guess in your valley you was higher then self
Work, short from another fly guy
By george i think he's got it 
Chicks gooms and lump sums
Trickering 5-0 wild to be like dumb dums
One of the few never having a heart
Issue was smart some ass with it 
Came to cash don't give a shit
Attitude more money, and more money
Dog days bright, and more sunny
4 in the morning drinking Seneca apple juice in the rent a car
Neighborhood star, got riddled and scarred
A lose cannon or cannons
Over famish foe, became shadow or did death and did (damage)
Now I knew this kid true to life
Word life, he preached righteousness and shit
And turned to be a ""Hypocrite""",Hypocrite,1997

[O.C.]
Style like somethin the microphone fiend would spark
Sort of reminiscing, of how it used to go down in the parks
Equipment ropped off, you can hear the vagas echo for miles and breath
Bass pounds the asphalt
Thunder vibration shake like a tremble from a earthquake and
O.C. a classic in the making, mental make thoughts
My physical form words
Hot in my mouth like a joust, no doubt
Some a phenomenon, mic technician, electrician
Spit the mic down the middle like an el producto
And throughout the resin, then asapoltin this shit
Gift to gather a rhyme, make rap a staired son
The way I do this, switch up the fluid
So smooth you want to persuie it
I'm raw like underground sewage you
This shit for insight? Well I'm back, never was gone
What I right, be tighter than pin stripes
Born by mob boss, my flause in affect on the mic
Keep it tight, with out a fight is raw, it's only right

[sample from live event]
I know it's hot, we hot too
You ready to throw down, we ready to have a party
So if ya ready to have a party, make some noise!

[O.C.]
Any mic I hold it in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd
Dictatin shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic schoolin
Bringin samatics to this rap shit
Bonafied, mic set you can't see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live, a life and die until then
Imma keep on writin the slick rhymes with the pen
Take the cherry from a tree, like a virgin havin innocence
Bust my nuts, bringin rhymes to live like Genesis
But ritical renaissance
In death there's a flautless
Tearin shit up when it comes to me pickin up a cordless
One of New York's finest, on this trip I co-incide with be	 Minus
Bringin out the best in me, we formulatin like a recipe
What I emplore, will show nuff disto my presence
Then I'm divine like the seven
Keepin it tight 'cause what safice is raw nigga, it's only right

Chorus 4X

[O.C.]
Microphone's I melt down, slap crowns, push em out of bounds
Crush ya crowd, as I lay my third verse down
Because, this is what I want, to gain control of that position
It's only right, that I follow through compition
Be warning me, homocide rhymes or mad rounds
To get flass or pencil hurt, battin me down
Contents flex text expert, since my born date
5/13/71 like a stick bin, injection
Inside ya blood stream, digest what I manifest
O.C., you best by me, others are mediocre like
I slam the earth like a meteor right
'cause I'mma take mine, leavin you face down in the puddle
Blow up like a shuttle, when I give you my rebuttle
Frame of mind, across state lines
Await the taste, me like fine wines from Avidian
For those who want to select cyphers to cyphers stash
Straight up, I don't rhyme for niggas
I prove myself, stylin for years on the mic
On another level of being, what's the be	 Minus? It's only right

Yo, my movement motion
Smooth or rough as the ocean
Sometimes it slip away and I lose devotion
My judgement get cloudy
Then I want to get rowdy
Like Arabia
Terrorize like Saudi Arabia
My avons reflects my mood swing
Switch colors like a mood ring
Wifey telling me good things
So I won't strain
Got grey hairs, and only been here 25 years
Shed tears for niggaz I knew for life, now lifeless
When you died to us, was like the Iranian crisis
I took it hard like a flick slow mo' breathing
Prophetize dot of a book______summer night's dreaming
Semi-wet as I write this
Dragging the cancer sticks
Smoke thick, Hennessey shots to my wig
Half naked while I jot this
Lounging in my boxers
Dreaming Tahiti, even settle for the Bahamas
I get a boner
When am asleep dreaming that I'm louging on a yaucht
(Chillin in the sun), bom bout the leave the docks
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

(Chorus)
Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

I'm searching for the light like Noah
The flame combust
Upon the bush forseeing my future like the Nova
Pushing for the brighter side of living a life
A better time pouring rhymes like wine
Till my cup run it over
Temptation on my shoulder
I'm growing colder then a polar bear
Thinking about a bank hold up
I fall upon my lap, and rest my head upon my knee caps
Is it a crime that I be dreaming about the G's black?
Freeze for a minute, gotta take control of my life
Gotta hold it like a knife
Must have more then a slice you know
Frustration, mental masturbation, (confusion)
Life is love living till I'm right be in a illusion
Seclusion, seeing me is rare
I rather attain stacks mack the islands on a plane ready for lift off
And spend grands, sipping exotic juice
Laying in the shade and shores
At a fly resort, on my cell contact the D.I.T.C. cohorts
Talking to the God Finesse
We tight like indians with a mohawk
And so on,
Conversation going on do the math
Dreaming I leave the___ Champagne bubble bath
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

(Chorus 2X)
Stress, frust, make me want to bust
Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

(Your working hard for the dough)
But time seem to go slow
Busting your ass to go from a amateur to a pro
Low budget feeling inside no more can you score
Bad and good fight inside just like a war
(Slavery later foundation for my nation centuries before 
 Final Call be the New World Order) 
2 K's on it's way, no time for play
So I prey to God got me on a path of righteuos ways
Even though i get stressed, and frustrated
The best time for me to bless a rhyme is to put the pen through a test
(Yeah I want the riches
 The misses on my side on a pool, with the night
 When blitzed, and magic like a grand wizard)
Official O.C. a two syllable sound
Three six incomplete like the earth was round
And on that note keep hope alive
Striving to rise
From the inner soul
Seeing through the eyes of a crow you know
Slow pacing walk forth is only right
separating the cause
From another man ""Far From Yours""
(Going for mine still coming off a two year hiatus)
And in that time nigga's bit my shit like alligators
It's alright though this rap shit is stress for us
It makes you feel like your in a hallway robust with angel dust
Reality i wake up to
My old dad once told me how you live your life is all on you son

Make me want to cuss

Bustin' so much shots
When my shells hit the ground it sound like ""Rock the Bells""

Call me Bumpy Knuckles 'cause my hands be swell
From knockin' niggas out from the lies they tell
Oh well, I bet you feel me all up in ya chest
I make the saucest nigga catch a body blame it on stress

I waited long time sweatin it
I got jerked but now I'm gettin it
Hazy like asthma bizarre disaster
Stress almost held me down from bein a master
The faster, preacher, poet, a teacher
""It's been so long"" like Monifah
Believe that, I'm needed, in rappin, I breathe this
Some pick up a microphone and can't even achieve this
Oscar award winning your shit I'm bored with it
Stop copy-catting son (why?) cause your dog did it
Get your own lingo, make up your own jingle
Ten years later you be bitin my single
Primo, take it Downtown, Swing it

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
and if you stand in my way you bound to get dropped

Some wish that I was gone cause they know I'ma win

then analyze the information and press send

obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe

Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz
I'm O.C., who you?  I never heard of ya
Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer
I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car

want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow

Ain't a man alive who could stop my noise
I snatch a star from the sky, spark up your lye
You stand astounded wonderin how I did it
Now you're star struck, like I truck gold
Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold
Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files
Rappers know I'm comin so they go in exile
Czar in this rap shit, comin on your mattress
Microphone fiend I make beats do backflips
Fear me like genocide, serious
How I do it through your stereo, mysterious
O.C. do demolition, nil competition
Like robot Kong on a destroy mission
A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath
I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest
Who the best, from New York to Bogota
Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit
What I be bringin is a terrible sight
A performance never again performed on the mic

Johnny O.C.,"Hey love...
Yeah...

Shopping in the city one day
On my way, met a redbone by the name of Stronjay
Five foot six, body thick, hair silky
She could make the hardest man melt and turn milky
Bugged out shit, one eye was hazel, one was blue
Lips fully packed as my attention stayed glued
Upon her outline, I cased it with my mind
Saying to myself, 'this sugar be a dime'
Yo sugar, let's have a drink, and um, talk some more
Proceed to grab my bag, and then we exit the store
Walking down the street, men is staring with amazement
Treatment something like black ???????????????
Anyhow, the star and me hit a sushi bar
Told her that I never had sushi before
Ordered saki that I already endeavored in Japan
Reached 'cross the table then I grabbed her hand
Why your man let you walk around solo like this?
My chinky eyes looked upon her as I gave her hand a kiss
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

Chorus:
Stronjay, a beautiful thing I must say
Her body got curves like waves in The Bay
Lips light smooth, just like Alize
The bizomb, I couldn't see her blowing my way

Stronjay responds, men only want her 'cause she rich
Her beeper start buzzin' so we pullin' out a flip
In the back of my mind, I'm sayin' 'yes, go ???????'
Find a nigga rich in New York's one in a million
She wanted to leave, I said 'Is this the end?'
Then she gave me an invitation back to her crib
I never surprise, I flag a cab, she says 'un uh'
My car's round the block in the parking garage
Got the vehicle, ???? the speed like Batman out of his cave
500 Benz whippin' in the wind
Destination 57 Park Ave. south
Turn my face a little, wipe the slob from my mouth
The building was immaculate inside with marble floors
We hit the elevator, she slips out of her draws
I'm shocked like goodies and I don't know how to take 'em
Titties in my face and like a gun I must face 'em
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

CHORUS

Top floor, penthouse suite for sure
It was classy like some type of fly furniture store
She grabbed me up and intertwined into a kiss with me
I tried taking off my clothes, she assisted me
Upon her fireplace wall is were I pushed her back
Then on the plush floor we fell; passionate collapse
She pushed me off, but the push wasn't mean
To the fridge, and came back with strawberries and whipped cream
The scene is set, but baby not just yet
'cause strawberries and whipped cream ain't complete without Moet
Foreplay; nibblin' my tongues in the air
Layin flat on her back, I love tappin' on the rear
Nuff time we spent gettin' excited, I'm delighted
Excstasy, I know honey-hun she won't fight it
She stands up, and lead me by my hand, we fled
Into a room with a king size canopy bed
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Satisfied O in like each and every way

Johnny O.C.,"Uh yeah uh uh uh
What, Crooklyn Dodger Number 2
O.C., yeah back in the scene muthafucka
Me and Premo, you know, East New York
Bushwick, Bedstuy, and all those good places

Yo
My main frame, discipline like a soldier
Ready for war, pushups get my chest swoll up
What's the deal Preme? I mean the scaze
I think I got it locked in nigga, War Games is the theme
Rap commando, what's my handle
O.C. ample to rock shit
Battle niggas who pop shit
Green bareen thought slicka
I'm one step ahead, slide thru enemy lines like a black ack figga
Camouflage, runnin thru you zone with detection
Cuz the dark skinned marksmen
Run thru your section
Flesh ya bones, physical built like titanium
Bugs cover my grill like Iranians
Ill gorilla so called killas
I fear no man but Allah, for the god is he is still in us
The Renaissance Man, I roll with real like grenade
sharp like gem stars
Cause massive scars
O.C.'s all in it, dope I've been for years
Now I'm back in the scene, and I declare War Games

I bust off like a M-16
Rippin thru screens from head to toe, blood soak up your jeans
Rap veteran, earn my stripes, faught wars
Opposing forces, would O.C. take losses?
Naucious, you feelin kinda like throwing up
Cautious, watch ya step, land rhymes blowin up
Havin a pity for foes, fuck G.I. Joe
He's a sucker, slap the taste outta wild motherfuckas
Design a rhyme, like a plan for the government
Six Million like Steve Austin, costin
Apprehended if I am
In times and my body will erupt *explosion*
M-16 tapecatin, voids filled with ammo
Bust it through a crowd, a bitch nigga sing soprano
When I get you in the square, then I end you career
All MC's lets make one thing clear
You're all the same, I will remain, fuck the fame
Feelin the lane to shoot, I declare War Games

[Chorus: x2]
I declare War Games
For niggas who flaunt figgas for more fame
Gorilla warfare, tactics issue unlimited access to ammo
With fire proof camouflage and power

Precise pinpoint it, pull it, when I cock back
This here rap will slap you and your team, and that bad bitch
Sleaves from my uncut, raw like cope
Preme dig up boys, roll up and smoke
Then toge it, back to B.I.
See I can do this, I'm professional
Too much weight to weigh any style
Dutch Master superior blend, inhale me right
Young Phillies take a toke of my rap, and get the
Willies para-
Noid, niggas all non void
Fuck with O.C., get your life destroyed
Like a marine, I'm a trained rap killing machine
Fiend to rock a mic, set from New York to New Orleans
Over seas I conquer, rough like blanca
Love to eat actors, gotta take for drama
When I flow I get comatose
In my own world
From the first verse, you saw my plan unfurl
I mean team same name, never change
My ammo is the demo competition on the mic

Rrrrahhhh! 

Who got the hardest, MC style, ever created? 
Who got celebrity, status, and is still underrated? 
Who got them two glock nines that be black and nickel plated? 
And I'll blow a nigga's chest out, to keep me motivated 
My periphreal, sees MC's, that ain't nice with these 
So all my new rivalries'll be, MC robberies 
I got these niggaz shook like, Shake-N-Bake, cook like 
I knock your punk ass out, wake you up, and I show you 
What I look like, who's that MC, that thinks that he can fuck with 
F-are-E-D-D-I-E, excuse me, Bumpy Knucks 
I don't give a fuck, if it's friend or foe 
This shit is my job to let you niggaz know so don't take it personal 
When I stick this verse in you, I don't know what you gon' do 
Even if you get your crew I'll walk through the stage 
Like it's Hoe Stroll Avenue, tappin on them pockets 
Puttin tabs on your revenue, now dig this 
It's mad niggaz that be thinkin they nice with they flow 
It's mad niggaz that be frontin like they holdin some dough 
It's mad niggaz that'll challenge me and after the show 
They Don't want to Be Players no mo', like Joe 
Niggaz try and come at me, with contemporary gangsta 
Fusion I'm smashin with the simple shit I'm usin 
Bashin and bruisin, who's in charge, BUMPY 
Step up in my face I leave your forehead LUMPY 

[Chorus] 

I bring the pain like a slice to your vein, fuck your fame 
Platinum and gold plate, don't hold no weight 
I be that, prophetic soul drainer, ain't a motherfucker 
In his right mind steppin in my cipher tryin to take mine 
From West coast to East I'm full-fledged 
Bust the science, niggaz better know the ledge 
O see all, I G off, enemy I spot you 
Two rhymes to my one verse, you go first 
You tasteless face it, I engrave my name in your scalp 
Like Damien, out for world domination 
Don't get me wrong, I don't represent 666 figures 
I'm just out to make figures 
Who holds the threshold, to be the best 
I crunch niggaz with my gold teeth like, vegetables 
Carnivorous deliverance, murder one nemesis 
Like a virgin, I snatch your innocence 
Talkin bank robberies when you rhyme, hold up 
You turn pussy on the mic when I roll up 
Coca-Cola, a fission like soda 
While you say butter, I'ma say Mazola 
Money folder hold a grudge cold like a polar bear 
Thug niggaz what? Blowin up spots like a SCUD 

Win the G, win the G 
Win the G, RRRRAHHHH! 

Who's that New York nigga left, that be nice like B.I. 
G.I., niggaz can't see I, see why? 
You new poppin niggaz, and you crew hoppin niggaz 
Step up in my face, and Bumpy be, 2Pa-cin niggaz 
If this bitch up in yo' heart, I'ma find it 
If you think I'm talkin to you, then just rewind it 
I got six shots behind this, even with a vest on 
Ya yellin, because I aim for the melon 
I'm a felon, and I bet you never, been in a fight 
Kinda like you really, never said shit on this mic 
So if I diss a nigga hustlin that makes me a displayer 
And if you buy my record twice, that makes you a two-payer/toupee-er 
And if your girl like Donna Karan, that makes her a DK-er 
And cause I hate your punk ass, that don't make you no playa 
Without this record business shit you niggaz is broke as fuck 
Smokin weed smokin woolies while I smoke your luck 
And while your flow needs, medical aid 
I just appear on niggaz shit, and I still get paid 
Now where's my G nigga? 

What niggaz'll think they made of steel and want to play brave? 
Bitch MC's will find theyself in the grave 
I make slaves of niggaz in ways never made 
Voice like an Ox or better yet sharp as a blade 
Intense the moment like sex when I'm bonin 
Iller than Caligula brainwashed the Romans 
I set it, let it be known, better beware, better be careful 
Who dared to oppose my phenomenal flows, how dare you? 
I smite your ass quick fast like Flash runnin past your ass 
Niggaz'll end up with whiplash 
But for the moment, I'm zonin, any opponents 
I'ma cut it short right now, because this rap shit we own it

OC phenomenon

Chorus:
Here goes a little somethin', for you and your mans
Dedicated to you and yours, from me and my fam
Living life to the limit with the world in my hand
I got nothin' but love for ya main man

Yo, yo, yo, with this here shit, I freak it like a wiz
And uh, lace the track like my nigga Showbiz
I'm uh, kinda sore with the microphone, pah no doubt
OC gon' turn it on out
Yes uh, follow me now if you didn't follow before
How shall I attend to ascend this raw
You pull up to a light, knockin' my hits, flickin' your Bic
Gold chain thick, to the chicks, lickin' your lips
They hop on it, to my cassette like a cock
They feenin' for what I give like puffin' a rock
?????, food for thought like my nigga A.G.
Givin' NYC, nigga I live in it
Let's go, mess no, rhyme I bless the flow
Dippin' with UNI, swerve, control the Lex though
Boppin' with Jigga, droppin' jewels to beats
Then I bounce and ghost ride with my main man Sweets
He can wax a nigga

CHORUS

As sure as my name is OC, I hold much testosterone
And serve like hors d'ouevers
I'm maximum, human saxophone
You respect what I'm saying like Al Capone
You crumb bubble gum rappers I chew
Blow you up, spit you out like food without seasonin', you got no taste
Yo OG, who could solo with me?
These kids be half grown
I'm an adult, seen it all
I'm forced to show VI's can duck proper
My ways and actions, far from an imposter
Shine like bright light
Your worst nightmare like Fright Night
Comin' to you live like a fight night
Must you steal the way I drop bars on this?
Perfection at it's best, I'm marvelous
Applaud me you better, I ???? to get a response
Control shit at the snap of a finger like I'm the Fonz
Fella whattup?

CHORUS

You say it ain't so, how I freak the flow
Joey Crack type shit nigga, blow for blow
Big G, Dog Tag Crew holdin' it down
Cousin Boo will make a you and bust shots at you
You see, it's my world, or like so it seems
Chillin' with Prim, dippin' on the highway in a Beem
And it's a wonderful day, just coolin' one night
Celebratin' a par-tay with a nigga named ""Life""
We twisted, kid you missed it
At a down low spot, Champagne poppin' off like a biscuit
Nuff love, word life, I'm high tonight
No brawls or fights, just men, no mice
Indecisive about things in life alone
So sometimes I speak in a hyper tone
See I won't neglect this, nor can you deny
Renassaince man, make it live, the fly guy
Respect me like a Kennedy, acknowledge my identity
O's like a cure, I'm the source, the remedy
You know it

I got nothin' but love for the Rockafella, Jay-Z
I got nothin' but love for the Wastelands Family

Johnny O.C.,"You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
Bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about 
Or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
But turned bitch and knowin' damn well they lack
In this division the connoisseur, crackin' your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin' like Noah
Always sendin' you down, perpetratin' facadin' what you consider
A image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too

Speakin' in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
And glocks gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin' it?  Why you lyin' for?  I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin' class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin' in this thing called rappin' just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote
That's what I consider real, in this field of music
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'
The traps are not stickin', rappers stop flippin'
For those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too",Times Up,2004

Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall? 
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest.

Red magic satin playing near, too

Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

Pretty music, I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flower echo
From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue

""Is it cool?""

If you arrive and don't see me

See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'

With velvet roses diggin'

'cause a brother want to bail to the mall
To ball wit all the blunts
Treat me right you deserve some dough
But never earn my trust
Stop trippin you can wae the bun
Sit back in the smoothe ride
Hit the block for ya homies hollarin two time
And i ain't thinkin bout ya other man
All i'm thinkin bout is ends and a tight benz

Johnny P,"Whoa
And ya got that sex appeal

She had a walk too sassy
Approachin' with a dog that looked like Lassie
The lipstick, and the Fendi, Prada
Kinda lookin' all classy
Psychological tendency, proto-call
Just lookin' at the article
Weed smell on my Prada clothes
Sometimes, I trip on myself
How I spit at these modern ho's
On the two-way, poppin' and droppin' the conversation
And I'm steady staggerin'
Look at the Remy that I had last week off Madison
Tryna walk a straight line
But I can't find a pattern in her
I looked at the door
Put my drink on the floor
Cocked my nine when I opened it slow
Half-breed Chinese, sittin' a Lac
And about a hash green, plus
The audacity of the star
Strippin' and maneuver her ass like next to me
Actually, this S-E-X is testin' me
A-double-P, E-A-L
And it sound like her body is callin' me
But it might be the alcohol in me
And the sex appeal, it keep on drawin' me

Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal
Sex, sex, appeal
Her body keep callin' me, whoa
Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' 'bout sex appeal, girl, whoa right
Sex, sex, appeal, whoa-ah

I'm finna get her off, high Hydro
Bump a crown from mista porch
Hey there lil' mama
Do you wanna come kick your heels
In the back of my Range Rove?
Wanna do what'chu did before?
Don't trip, cause ""You Already Know""
C-O-M-E-B-E-W-I-X-T, that me, Belo
Just do it ""Nice And Slow""
You gotta raise the door
And I don't pay for show
'Cause I don't pay fo-sho
You can grab yo' kicks and go
Put on yo (shh), let's roll
Recognize the G, true ballin'
Do or die, pimp or die, not fallin'
When we all in, yo club
Chillin' with the chiefs and the dubs
And I got love for the jiggaboos
Pop Chrys' with the niggas, and the bitches too
Dig a bitch out the Grove, like I just do
People say I'm like a statue
Spit the B in yo ear
Take you off to the real, and I match you
Sex appeal

Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal
Sex, sex, appeal
Her body keep callin' me, whoa
Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' 'bout sex appeal, girl, whoa right
Whoa-ah, na, na, na

Go kick it wit' my niggas in the drop Regal
Do what, a Twista, Caddy, Po-Pimp sequel
On my way to the club, peek-a-boo motherfucka
But first I gotta roll one, for my people
Hate us for doin' that, saw us
Through Windy City, nightcrawlers
Who would have imagined lyricals on the legacy?
Cities legendary like, Rap-A-Lot and Legit Ballaz
Shit, let the Mo' pop, and drop the top
Ride like it's summertime in the Chi
Get'chu blind, to the abra
Blowin' lime to the sky
Rhyme til' I die, tryin' to get by
Lil' miss, lookin' tight in the coochie
Whether it's a Gucci
Love the way you do the jiggy when you walk
Soundin' like you freaky, girl, every time you talk
I know ya aura make the fellas wanna break 'em off
Hear me brotha?
Gotta try to get our feet further
Hit a lic' and feed, one-another
'Cause all we got is, each-other
I take it week after week
And to kick the flows that I freak but, uh
Roll up on a chick and spit game
Let me show you how the back seat of a Lexus feel
Take a hit of cess and chill
Girl, dressed to kill
Whippin' that sex appeal
Next appeal?

Sex, sex, appeal (whoa)
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal, hey
Sex, sex, appeal

Sex, sex, appeal (callin', callin', callin' me)

Sex appeal, sex appeal (talkin' about)
Sex appeal, sex, sex appeal (oh yeah)
Sex appeal, sex appeal (bring it on, bring it on)

Said ya body just callin' me
And ain't nothin' like an orgy
Back it all, girl (aah-aah)

Johnny P,"[2Pac]
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see,
Through all the rain and the pain,
You gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
Keep ya head up.Yeah.
Verse One: 2Pac
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now

[Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)]
Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile (smile), smile for me
(What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile
(And the next generation)

[Scarface]
Now as I open up my story
With the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
 
[Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Chubby thug ballin in the white tee
Roll a Swisher up and take it to the head
Havin fantasies of havin me two bitches in the bed
Dark-skinned and light-skinned like Mike, both of 'em lookin right
Spectacular when I get up in them legs
Have you ever seen a light-skinned freak
Butter pecan or vanilla, nipples and her pussy pink
(Hazel-eyed jet black baby hair that'll hurt yo' hearrrrrrt)
Have you ever seen a dark-skinned freak
Sexy and chocolate when she droppin in, my African Queen
(When she starts what is she like a Hershey bar)
The three of us need to drive up to an exotic place
Where y'all can double up on me, take me to outer space
Or we can keep it ghetto while hang in the hood on the porch
And later on we can fuck in front of the fireplace
But for now I'm only dippin through the block
Expressin to you all of the feelings in my chest
Wishin I could find a couple of girls on what I'm on
So they could help me end my stress, until then I'm just

Talkin jazzy at the mouth, cause she think she the shit
Thinkin everybody around supposed to bow down to her
cause she's bored, but she's still my bitch
Now come take a look at miss black
Always got an attitude, and she stay on the attack
Why you always wanna whup a nigga ass, tellin me I'm bogus
But I love you cause yo' ass so fat
So now I gotta pimp my ride
Custom material, computer, and chrome on the side
Paint job can make you look like butter rollin
but you ain't rollin unless you got some twenty-fo's on the ride
And the do' suicide
Niggaz hatin but the bitches on the dick when the do's go up
Let the enemies see it good
When the homies in the ride and the forks and the fo's go up
... steady bendin through the block, and I'm tryin to find a ho

Everybody call me Twista, representer for the city of the dough

To ball wit all the blunts

Ain't trippin' got to split up the front
Approach you with a limp while I hit on the blunt
Your pager goin' off (oh, that ain't nothin')
Meet me at the crib bout 2, stop frontin'
Blow to the bone as I clicked on somethin'
Tryin' to cut me up, yeah the trick's on somethin'
The corner of the party where the niggas stay bumpin'
This is for the gin and the hen in my stomach
I'm lookin' at the do' females still comin'
Lookin' to my left and the B's still comin'
Lookin' to my right and the drinks still comin'
Tryin' to shake the dice but the girl lookin' cunnin'
Circlin' the do' where the money start runnin'
Took a pause, hey y'all whats up
Head hunters in the double-R, is it a double car
Pulled over to the car
So I, asked Proceeds, to pass the B's, no bitch

Do you wanna rock with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's

Wanna be like P-I, M-P, hoes, plenty

Lean back in the corner with the dob hat
Now my nature is to ball like a democrat
In the club with hoes, and I suppose
That I've been chose, the nigga with the hoodrat
Mm, mm, mm, mm, got it down pat
You call her what you want or even all that
I been taught by the best, so put it to rest
And I confess, I'm here just to ball black
Gettin' paid in the game bend a row free
Flip a penny to a dime I'm like an O-G
Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B
You can ride or just smoke in the Cadillac
AC, windows down, with the top back
From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put in a roll, tell me could you top that?
Ever though I'm makin' money in a row friend

Different strokes, same folks, hangin' from a rope
Me and Do or Die just try to cope
Sit back and like a picture take a toke
Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another bad boy, playa pimpin' to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shorty what's the deal?

I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be ""Passin' Me By""
I'm a nigga with peas and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fiends drip, ours is full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
No more servin' the rock 'caine, the night-game
Flippin' flows like hoes which is a drop-game
It's like, aw suki suki now, lookie here
Stick a phrase while I trades on my hog road
Divine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin' and she peepin' that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin',
Peepin' the Mediterranean try to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin' cold women
Bendin' and grinnin my hair spinnin'
While we smokin' on Henny, still po pimpin'

For lovin me inspiting mines

[Verse 1 ]
 I never had a women babe
To treat me like you do
And that's the main reason I want to do right by you
Now there's some things in my life that I know ain't right
I don't want to lead you on
So every night when you hold me tight
I feel so wrong

[Chorus:]
You gave me your love girl (but I don't deserve it)
Your always there for me(but I don't deserve it)
You gave me heaven lady little lady ( but I don't deserve it)
You given me everything, everything (but I don't deserve it)

[Verse 2:]
This morning when I woke up you served me breakfast in my bed.
But the thought of another women keep running in my head (in my head)
You wash my clothes and cooked my food
And I asked for nothing in return
I should treat you and caress you too
But I don't have the nerve

You loving me up and down (but I don't deserve it)
You never showed a difference and in my kids (but I don't deserve it)

Sipping on Hennesey
And I, can never pay your bills
Cause I gotta keep it real, real, real

So ain't no scrub in me, me, me
Police, can't see me ballin'
Sipping on Hennesey

First of all, you can shut it down baby
Better yet I'm original and not a clown baby
Get down for wars an' I'm, living my life under the gun
And umm, stay calm no harm, I'm alarming 'em
And that's the victim of the shorties in my grill
Asking me to keep it real, but shorty I don't pay no bills
Do I gots the flex to get with you, paint you a cold picture
See, why y'all the ones got me slapping out
And all my homeboys japping out
Crapping out, love that, where my Crips and my Bloods at?

Niggas blaze that weed sack
I'll cop a drop wit that knees fat

Why you trying to play that mack for?

Then you gotta be a hellafied nympho
Open up let some air through the window
I could never give my money to a bimbo
Real players get high off endo
Make cash like the owners of the Timbo
Chi-Town, real player, real true love
20 inch on the rims, fucker says what?
Bet the po' to the next thug
Recognize the queen, you come to me
But you gotta see, you're a what-what?
Gotta sign then flip bitch
Hit the block, I'ma rhyme in the Hummer
Better be on some platinum shit
Roley bling bling, keep a gat want to snap it
Been well known to react quick
When they see I got a star, they pause and they react quick
I'm immune to the hot shit, nevertheless
Shitty just beware of where the hat fit
Yo pimp where the plastic?
This pimp, real pimp, it's the pimp like a maverick
Playerism is a habit
I'm at the club wit 'um wit Crystal, what what

Lil' baller be me, can't see me
Never get her with a TV, cause we be

Dyslexic on the passenger side
Don't mean that I ain't got the keys to ride
She's the pie, my, my, my
We done came to fuck and get gone, pay no bills
Flex the mind to make the bank to bounce
Nigga bounce shit like the Dirty South
Watch that shit with a dirty mouth
Know you ain't mad, ain't splurging out
But if ya heard me out, on the passenger side
Care to bore me with the rest of the guys?
Spitting blunts, dropping jewels
Spitting at hoes, that'll be cool

Pay no bills, pay no bills

would you come come come would you come come come

[Verse 1]
3 double O AM she step into my x-5 beamer
You should have seen her
With a rubber perfection you can put it in a session with Janet Jackson
Little league the chemistry was up to satisfaction
With a magnificent ark spark bringing flame like a arsons
I locked the door and drove off and I drove off kind of slowly
Cause the popo's always blow me
And this is what she told me, she put her lips to my ear move closely
When we got into traffic she indicated what she working with and put her
lips around my LORD HAVE MERCY
I drove and watch, I watched them grow, I spit my hen, I smoke my dro.. shit
In between conversations she was like....she was like...oohhh oohh ooh oh oh ooohhhh
You already know, she was already blown, she was already gone
She was already sprung gone with her tongue uh huh uh huh

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Late at night all alone dream of you in those thongs, girl I wake up in the morning

I feel you on top of me, baby girl on top of me
I like the way you moan girl don't you know you got that humm girl

[Verse 2]
I'm on the phone talking to Mrs. Who
I don't want to pump till the bottom white bloom
Tip type game all the things you do
Let her tease me, outta tease you
Baby want to come at 3 AM
She giving me the keys to the new be	-M
Plus she giving me and you won't see him
And she giving me to the you see them
Pick up the phone then arrive at the door
She came out and the white touched the floor
Gotta lay back cause the rain goin pour
Hope for the shade make it one night more
Looking like a diva with the queens on tour
I belong she's allmo
In the bedroom now its time for sex
Anything goes you can walk like mex
After making love and I will not jet
Up and down and around we go
I can feel her nails when she scream below
I'm a real pimp see I still gotta go
Some get pussy and they still don't know

[Verse 3]
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (be gone)
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah now throw yo half
Put back on the things you ask
You the man when it's double dare I'm L I'm L

Cause please, that be me sparkin sharp and bendin calm in that lac
Bendin hard with ladys slobbin and bobbin

See, she like them top notch with the glock cocked
Put the money and glock block them CEO's who invest in stock plots
Substance blowin out the sunroof with your drop top
Smokin on that chop flop ladys call me pa pa and groupies call me na na

Nothing
I be stackin them stacks bringin em back in the back of the lac
Talkin in codes to the burn outs hustlin daily got me turned out
You know my motto to invest and chase that paper like lotto
Follow, tryin to bring back money in car loads
But its hard to listen when you tryin to get that platinum benzy
Or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
Its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
Track that feeling like a spasm
Tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
They off in the breeze but it ain't nothing
If you got that paper then say something
Better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off,
When you just want to hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
Recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
Check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
Get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really ain't the way the best will go
And its so cold in these windy streets
When the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit

Now or a forty X5 5 of those sit back relax and private show
No how it go more money more problem well the problem is you solve it
Don't let the money become you you take it and revolve it
No matter how you get it you hustle and go get it square stick with it
Make sure all the numbers split Cause all of them done did it

To many other people got paper but we homeless
And let alone this, we chillin while we swervin bumpin 92.3 in the suburban

Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now

[Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)]
Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile (smile), smile for me
(What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile
(And the next generation)

Now as I open up my story
With the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
 
[Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

You ain't never seen no motherfucker pimp like me
Stay up in the street lookin for honies throwin money in the club
Chubby thug ballin in the white tee
Roll a Swisher up and take it to the head
Havin fantasies of havin me two bitches in the bed
Dark-skinned and light-skinned like Mike, both of 'em lookin right
Spectacular when I get up in them legs
Have you ever seen a light-skinned freak
Butter pecan or vanilla, nipples and her pussy pink
(Hazel-eyed jet black baby hair that'll hurt yo' hearrrrrrt)
Have you ever seen a dark-skinned freak
Sexy and chocolate when she droppin in, my African Queen
(When she starts what is she like a Hershey bar)
The three of us need to drive up to an exotic place
Where y'all can double up on me, take me to outer space
Or we can keep it ghetto while hang in the hood on the porch
And later on we can fuck in front of the fireplace
But for now I'm only dippin through the block
Expressin to you all of the feelings in my chest
Wishin I could find a couple of girls on what I'm on
So they could help me end my stress, until then I'm just

Look at lil' red
Talkin jazzy at the mouth, cause she think she the shit
Thinkin everybody around supposed to bow down to her
cause she's bored, but she's still my bitch
Now come take a look at miss black
Always got an attitude, and she stay on the attack
Why you always wanna whup a nigga ass, tellin me I'm bogus
But I love you cause yo' ass so fat
So now I gotta pimp my ride
Custom material, computer, and chrome on the side
Paint job can make you look like butter rollin
but you ain't rollin unless you got some twenty-fo's on the ride
And the do' suicide
Niggaz hatin but the bitches on the dick when the do's go up
Let the enemies see it good
When the homies in the ride and the forks and the fo's go up
... steady bendin through the block, and I'm tryin to find a ho

Everybody call me Twista, representer for the city of the dough

And if you wanna try and get as lyrical like the twist
You gotta flow li-li-li-li like this.

Johnny Pace,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1958
Johnny Pace,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always

When the world is cold,

And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.

Cause I love you

Johnny Pacheco,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Como la lluvia moja todos los recuerdos
Al verte llegar la luna why el mar cubren
Nuestro encuentro

(Bésame)
No te detengas de una vez
(Abrázame)
Why cubre todo mi cuerpo
(Llévame)
A un mundo de fantasías que
Llenan mi alma
(Te amaré)
Con locura why por siempre
(Yo viviré)
A tu lado juntos de la mano
Llenando de vida el corazón

Voy a sellar tu cariño
A la orilla de algún rio (bis)

Para coronar el alma
Why ese corazón que es mío

Tú eres mi razón de ser, por ti yo viviré
Why sólo a tu lado siempre estaré

Tú eres mi razón de ser, por ti yo viviré
El amor en la distancia
Si es sincero es eterno (bis)

Como el beso que no olvido
Que lo llevo muy adentro

Tú eres mi razón de ser, por ti yo viviré
Why solo a tu lado siempre estaré

Tú eres mi razón de ser, por ti yo viviré
Mi razón de ser, por ti yo viviré

Tú eres mi razón de ser, por ti yo viviré

Mi razón de ser
Por ti yo viviré

Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near

'Cause I'm so lonely
 
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

'Cause lately I've been losing sleep

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

You've made me throw my old friend down

Johnny Pate,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Johnny Pate,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

Johnny Pate,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1957
Johnny Pate,"There's not a street that you can walk
You've got to watch just who you're talking to
They're out to get you
Can't turn your back on a smiling face
Next thing you know, there ain't no trace of you
And this I bet you
Some people lose and some folks win
It's a matter of what they do

[Chorus]
Are you man enough?
Big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot your down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend
Just around the bin
Don't you think you should be there?
Are you man enough
when the going's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

There's not pretending it goes away
With every step that you take you pay your dues
And I ain't lying
You got to struggle to see the light
Cause someone's looking to steal your right to choose
And they don't stop trying
It's like a jungle outside the door
And it's keeping you so confused

[Chorus]

Gotta keep your eye on the passersby
Better watch your step!
Cause you never know when the knife will go
And they ain't missed yet
The strong survive
They stay alive
They're always cool
But that they never teach you in school

[Chorus: Repeat x2]",Are You Man Enough,1973
Johnny Paycheck,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

Johnny Paycheck,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square 

Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said, ""Excuse me, Sir 
But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard and long hair"" 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that curb, an I thought to myself 
That's the house of the Lord, that guy's got the hell of a nerve 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees 

I said, ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind 
I just wanted to be with your people, Lord, it's been a long time"" 
A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears 
And I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years 

Then there's those fine cars parked outside, too many for me to count 
Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount 
Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it 
Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show 
Drinkin' beer, screamin, ""Sing 'Shove It'"" 

You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place 
With his coat made of camel hair an' sandals on his feet and a long beard on his face 
You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, and take 'em beyond the clouds 
To live forever in Heaven with you, well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd 

You know, Lord, I'm not perfect, some even call me no count 
But I'll tell you, I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, and not his bank account 
So if this is what religion is, a big car, a suit and a tie 

Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify 
Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you?

I've felt as lonely as I do tonight
I feel like I could lay down, and get up no more
It's the damndest feelin', I never felt it before

Tonight I feel like an old violin
Soon to be put away and never played again
Don't ask me why I feel like this, hell, I can't say
I only wish this feelin' would just go away

I guess it's 'cause the truth 
Is the hardest thing I ever faced
'Cause you can't change the truth
In the slightest way, I tried

So I asked myself
I said, ""John, where'd you go from here?""
And then like a damned fool 
I turned around and looked in the mirror

And there I saw, an old violin
Soon to be put away and never played again

Hook it now

Yeah 'cause I've done and felt the pain
And I've been caught in the damned ol' rain
Lord, it's hard to get off
The old white train
Well the old white train, it costs a lot to ride
It stole your heart and even your pride
It'll damn sure forever more honey
Freeze your brain
Take a little advice
Stay away from the cocaine train
Yeah take a little advice
Stay away from the cocaine train
Cocaine train

Alright",(Stay Away from) The Cocaine Train [Live],2002
Johnny Paycheck,"I delievered the orders from your last Stanley Party
Though I got some strange looks at the doors
And I cancelled our subscription to the Ladies Home Journal
And told Avon not to call anymore

Men have no need for magazines they don't read
For perfume and powder and such
Me and the house and everything in it
Have lost the feminine touch

The clock by our bed just gave up and stopped ticking
And the flowers on the mantel have died
The dust is gettin' deep on everything but the ceiling
And I've lost all my home owner's pride

Bottles are made from the bar to the bedroom
I've turned to such things for a crutch
Me and the house and everything in it
Have lost the feminine touch
Girl I sure miss your feminine touch",The Feminine Touch,2002
Johnny Paycheck,"I can't take your hurt and wish it away 
Or condemn a love you knew yesterday
I can't be the past you want to relive
My part of forever is all I can give

I can't be a part of some other time
Or free the memories that's chained to your mind
I can't take his dreams and make them live 
My part of forever is all I can give

All I can give is the love you see 
It's all that I have that belongs to me

I was not the cause of yesterday's rain
I never said the words that brought on the pain
The life you had with him is not mine to live 
My part of forever is all I can give
My part of forever is all I can give",My Part of Forever,2002
Johnny Paycheck,"The subject of this next song
Well, I guess it's been around forever
It deals with someone that's so much in love
He's blind to the truth
I think Merle wrote a classic line in this one
""Being a fool is one thing
But not knowing you're a fool is another thing""

Today a friend got through to me
I've been blind I couldn't see
'Cause my love was always standing in the way
Well I've been crazy, I've been blown
My good friends, they knew all along
Yesterday's news just hit home today

Well I've tried
Lord, and I've tried to stay on top of things
Never dreaming such a storm was on it's way
When you owned up to all those lies
I was the only one there that was surprised
Yesterday's news just hit home today

Well I guess the shock of learning that you've been a fool
Allows paranoia and insecurities to creep in
And I'll tell you it underminded our love honey
I thought would never end
You know being a fool is one thing
But not knowing you're a fool, honey, that's another thing
Yesterday's news just hit home today

Well I've tried and I've tried to stay on top of things
Never dreaming such a storm was on it's way
But when you owned up to all those lies
Honey, I was the only fool there that was surprised

Johnny Paycheck,"You ask me to give up a hand of the girl I love
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love 
Oh that's up to her yes and the Lord above
You better move on

Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings
But I believe she's happy with me without those things
Still you beg me to set her free 
But my friend that will never be
You better move on

I can't blame you for loving her 
But can't you understand she's my girl
Oh but I'm, I'm never ever gonna let her go 
Yeah, but don't you know I love that woman so

I think you'd better go now I'm gettin' mighty mad
Yeah, but you'd ask me to give up the only love I've ever had
Maybe I would oh but I love her so I'm never gonna let her go
You better move on 
You better move on 
You better move on
You better move on
You better move on
You better move on
You better move on",You Better Move On,2002
Johnny Paycheck,"Can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left 'em
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

What a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny I don't even care
As you turn to walk away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I have to say
It's been a good year for the roses

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say we haven't said
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind
I find I haven't said a word
From the bedroom the familiar sound of one baby's cryin' goes unheard

What a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny I don't even care
As you turn to walk away
As the door behind you closes
The only thing I have to say",A Good Year for the Roses,2002
Johnny Paycheck,"Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left and took all the reasons
I was working for
You better not try to stand in my way
'Cause I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more

I been workin' in this factory
For nigh on fifteen years
All this time I watched my woman
Drownin' in a pool of tears
And I've seen a lot of good folks die
That had a lot of bills to pay
I'd give the shirt right offa' my back
If I had the guts to say

Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left and took all the reasons
I was workin' for
You better not try to stand in my way
'Cause I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more

Well that foreman, he's a regular dog
The line boss, he's a fool
Got a brand new flattop haircut
Lord, he thinks he's cool

One of these days I'm gonna' blow my top
And that sucker, he's gonna' pay
Lord I can't wait to see their faces
When I get the nerve to say

Take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more
My woman done left and took all the reasons
I was workin for
You better not try to stand in my way
'Cause I'm walkin' out the door
