Buckeroos,"Oh, the sun's gonna shine in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Things are gonna be the way they were before
Love's gonna live here again

Buckeroos,"Mental cruelty that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty
Your Honor, since our marriage my life's not been the same
Why I'm missing out on all the fun and he's the one to blame
There's never any excitement now the way there used to be
And sharing his way of life is mental cruelty
Mental cruelty that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty
Divorces have been granted for many different things
Even when there's not a reason and no one can be blamed
With only two little words she's on her merry way
Yes all a woman has to claim is mental cruelty
Mental cruelty that's what I heard her say
Mental cruelty to the judge that day
I sat there in silence so she could be free
And listened to her lying words mental cruelty",Mental Cruelty,2016

No more dreams to dream no more schemes to scheme
No more happiness only loneliness no more skies of blue no more me and you

No more friends to face love's gone without a trace
No more skies of blue no more me and you",No More Me and You,2016
Buckeroos,"They say for everybody there is a fool
And that's the way it's always been 
Between me and you
Anytime you're ready you treat me like a friend
Cause you know that I'm just 
Following up to take you back again
Yes I'm nobody's fool nobody's fool 
Nobody's fool but yours
And although you do me wrong 
I'll still tag along 
'Cause I'm nobody's fool but yours

You falsely accused me of doing you wrong
That's just an excuse you used to string me along
A toy you play with and when you are through
You throw me away and find somebody knew
But I'm nobody's fool",Nobody's Fool But Yours,2016
Buckeroos,"Only you
Can make my dreams come true
Only you
Can turn my skies to blue
Love like ours
Should not be far apart
Only you

Buckeroos,"Open up your heart and let my love come in open up your heart and let my life begin
The sun's gonna shine there'll be blue skies again
When you open up your heart and let my love come in
I know you've been hurt by an old love affair

But darling don't blame me I wasn't even there
Your long lonely nights I will bring to an end
When you open up your heart and let my love come in
Open up your heart...

Someone before me has treated you like dirt
Someone before me has made your heart hurt

Buckeroos,"Over and over 
I've said that we are through 
Over and over 
I've said I'm leaving you
But when you say I love you my heart goes in a spin
And over and over I take you back again
Time and time again I've said this is the end
And told my heart forget what might have been
No matter what I'd do I can't get over you 
I love you over and over again

Time and time again...",Over and Over Again,2016
Buckeroos,"Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin

He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him

Well, they thought I was fast a sleepin'
They thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a peepin'
Or that I'd hear what was said

Santa put his arm around mama
And mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy
Then I'm a gonna tell on them

Well, Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin

Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him

I never saw Dancer or Prancer
I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the Red Nosed reindeer
Like they show on the TV screen

But he sure brought a lot of presents
So Santa Claus he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy
And daddy looked a lot like him

Well, Santa looked like daddy

Buckeroos,"You can dance, every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, l et him hold you tight
You can smile, every smile for the guy
Who holds your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darling save the last dance for me

Yes, I know that the musics fine
Like sparkling wine, go and have your fun
Dance and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darling save the last dance for me

You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If she asks if you're all alone
Can he take you home, you must tell him no
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Oh, darling,save the last dance for me

You can dance, every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile, every smile for the guy

Buckeroos,"I'll play second fiddle 
To your new love while it lasts
Just like all the others 
I've played for in the past
Why can't I be a leader 
And play your leading part?
Why must I always have to play 
Second fiddle in your heart?

Play fiddle play
Will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part
Of second fiddle to your heart?

Each time you find a new love, 
You leave me here to cry
The teardrops tell a story, 
Of a love that just won't die.
Like an early mornin' paper, 
The news you get just parts
Why must I always have to play 
Second fiddle to your heart?

Play fiddle play.
Will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part
Of second fiddle to your heart?",Second Fiddle,2016
Buckeroos,"If the angels have sweethearts then I want you for mine
I'd be a tramp and sleep in the street 
Or I'd be a beggar with rags on my feet
If I knew for sure when the time comes to part
Someday in heaven you'd be my sweetheart
Will there be sweethearts in heaven after we've crossed the line
If the angels have sweethearts then I want you for mine
(If I should go first and leave you behind to face life alone bear this in mind
I'll be a waitin' if heaven's my fate
To take you by the hand just inside the pearly gates)
Will there be sweethearts...",Sweethearts in Heaven,2016
Buckeroos,"Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you

Remember all of the good times
We had in days gone by
Remember all of the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You told me you would be leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
Now I hope and pray with each new day
That you'll come a-travelin' home

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you

I watch the mailman comin'
I wait by the telephone
I meet the trains down at the station
And I spend my nights alone
But now the waitin' is over
And Time has set the scene
'Cause God meant me for only you
And he meant you for me

Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you",Think of Me,2016
Buckeroos,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand

[Chorus]
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again

Buckeroos,"She knew I knew that she was out to get me 
But I just close my eyes and let it be 
Now she walks by me like she never met me 
I didn't even make a memory 

For I was under the influence of love 
I wonder now what I was thinking of 
Yes I was so in love I let her 
Hurtin' me though I knew better 
Under the influence of love 

Why did I let her do me like she done me 
Why can't I get that woman off my mind 
Although I know she never truly loved me 
I wish she break my heart just one time 

For I was under the influence of love 
I wonder now what I was thinking of 
Yes I was so in love I let her 
Hurtin' me though I knew better 
Under the influence of love",Under the Influence of Love,2016
Buckeroos,"[Chorus]
You've got me under your spell again
Sayin' those things again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreamin' those dreams again
Makin' those things again
I've gotta take you back just one more time

I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone

[Chorus]

Well, everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do

[Chorus]",Under Your Spell Again,2016
Buckeroos,"I got the hungrys for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Well I ain't got nothing but the shirt on my back and an old two button suit
I walked out on my job about a week ago and now I'm sleepin' in a telephone booth
But I'm a gonna be the richest guy around the day you say you're mine

I got the hungrys for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Well when I first met you babe you nearly made me wreck my old 49 Cadillac
Yeah I knew at a glance that it was you for me I had to have your love by heck
Now I'm right back where that I started from but that ain't gonna change my mind
I got the hungrys for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line

Well you made me the top dog on your hill and I was overjoyed
But it didn't take long until the thrill was gone I joined the ranks of the unemployd
Now I'm right back where that I started from but that ain't gonna change my mind

Where does the good times go?

Buckethead,"(TV voice 1)
He's as tall as a redwood tree,
He weighs 30,000 tons,
And he has the thorns of a hedgehog.
(TV voice 2)
Those are petty details, carrus.
(voice 1)
I want you to understand his rather... special talents...
(TV voice 3)
First of all, he has the strength of 10 monsters.
With one blow he can destroy the Empire State Building
With another, the highest peaks of mount everest would fall.

[slow intro]

(newscaster)
This just in: we have unconfirmed reports that Tokyo is under attack...
By a 50-foot man with a... white face?...
A chicken bucket on his head, uh... carrying an enormous guitar...
According to this report, whenever he plays a note...
The sonic waves cause whole buildings to explode,...
Streets to buckle and split and vehicles to fly about like toys...

THE DEFENSE COMMAND HAS ORDERED ALL CITIZENS TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY!!!...
People from sector 4 please report to the bus depot in sector 3...
Sector 5 proceed in an orderly fashion to sector 6...
Sector 1 & 2 board the bullet trains without delay...WAIT!...
We have visual contact... Look at the size of those shoes!!!...
Who is this giant? where did he come from? where is he going?...
What's he playing? what's he saying? RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!...

(newscaster)
It seems that this gargantuan figure is only destroying chicken outlets...
The liberated chickens appear to be... FOLLOWING him...
A white wave of feathered friends... eh... isn't this the year of the rooster?...
And here come the children following close behind... huh...
They're all headed toward a giant fortified chicken coop on Mt. Fuji...

Buckethead,"maybe you can answer this strange question
for me there young fella
if he was raised by chickens, then why does he eta chickens?

Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of
Pure imagination
Take a look
And you'll see
Into your imagination

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanta change the world?
There's nothing
To it

There is no

To compare with

Buckfast Abbey Choir,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Nine feet tall with really big hands
Living in a stump on his very own land

He was minding his own business on the day they came
They showed a piece of paper saying eminent domain
They built an apartment building saying progress was to blame
But he got mad
And he turned bad
Brick by brick he's gonna take his land back

So don't let fix it Felix and that building stand

Watch him get all turbo-charged when he eats a pie
Not just a superintendent
He's a super super guy
And everybody loves him

With his trusty tool belt and steel toed shoes
Nicelanders believe that Felix just can't lose
So when wreck it Ralph starts to come unglued
He doesn't get mad
'Cause he's so rad
Brick by brick he's gonna build it back

For making your mind up

Don't let your indecision 
Take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

And then you really gotta burn it up 
And make another fly by night
Get a run for your money and take a chance 
And it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up

And try to look as if you don't care less 
But if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game will let you find 
The one you're looking for
And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up

Don't let your indecision
Take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

And now you really gotta speed it up (speed it up)
And then you gotta slow it down (slow it down)
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top 
You gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

And now you really gotta speed it up (speed it up)
And then you gotta slow it down (slow it down)
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose

But I'm not trying to sing the blues
'cause life goes on, remembering the verse Nitty showed me the song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellowin' Juda blaze the Cocoa

But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick 'em off, soon be back to bill yo

On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows
My peeps keep me grounded, so my head don't blow
It's a struggle but the mo, I smoke the mo my mind flow

Losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high everybody fuckin' wit me
'cause they know I keep a pound of trees 'cause I gotta maintain in me
But I'm losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high
Gotta link with my B.N.C.

It's the life of my man who lived for the root of all evil
I can't knock him though, 'cause we was once consider peoples

Dump him for the love of money, by the root of O.J.'s
'Bout it to half smoke Philly comin' out the ash tray

I didn't even know, just knew my man, Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin' up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which body cocked thee
Returned to death stair, eye's full of blood shot

Try to block it wit a chuckel, hit that shit nigga, fuck you
Fuck him, pull my coat, just hop up on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin' on the rulers
Don't hit the spliff, less until you twist the Buddhas

I'm losin' my mind, rollin' my dime
Friend of mind, tryin' to lace my weed
That's a muthafuckin' friend I don't need

It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game

I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst shit that's what happen when you thrust

You think you comin' home, but you meetin' chrome
You really thought you had the throne, 'cause you was the bone
On the block, as the bomb rock, now you
Under a rock, so the money stop, gettin'

All the rules of the game, so you plan flop
Niggas seein' a vision, tryin' to make it to the top

'cause you know I gotta roll it in the leaf, can't fuck with no stemi

Yo there used to be a rumor about BDI
I wouldn't come back, I tell you no lie

Whenever I'm back, I'm bound to make a link

And if you read my diary it'd break your heart
Cause I been losin like a mutherfucka from the start
Excuse me--but that's the only way that I can express
My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair 
For real

Eyes watch as I make moves
Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I ain't sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my be	 and see
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time

Coppin' moet wit' two counterfeit fifties
What?
Dirty girl rhyme spit mucous
Speech uncoothe
And raise the roof like lukas
12 years done rocked through all phases
Watch your peeps scream the bitch was the blazest

Niggas run they mouth about my click
Not smart
I bust your bloodclot
Then drop you upon the sidewalk
(chi-chi-chi-blow!)
Hit ya ass wit a vicious blow
You know my style
Spliff the foul
Through your stereo
Spliff starr ignorant immigrant
I'm gettin' it
Money, fast car, fine broads, what
I'm hittin' it (that's right)
Raw shit I'm spittin' it

Giving me pound and holdin' grudge
Feelin' my shit

Hit you with a buck fifty

Plus I'm doing my thang
On the side
We won't let it ride
Nigga don't hide

Landlord innovator
Switch lanes no indicator
The general, cash generator
Master and savior
Nigga stay massive in nature
When tooth shatter ya die bone
In the savage cyclone of cops, sirens, and cases
Who read the bible for basics?
When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in god's places
Suspicious of all
Now who dat?
Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like cobra heads
Till I'm old and dead

Hot shit, toxic
You know we blocks shit
Traffic in the streets system
All in your jeep knocks shit
Julio for no reason back the fifth
And he cocks it
Rock shit, we make niggas mad
And wanna pop shit
Massive and attractive
Niggas is captive
Chemotherapy needed
Lyrics radioactive
When I hit hard
It get my dick hard
In my backyard
Analyze the stars
On how to defeat all odds
In a new zone
I'm on a new phone
Make most of the wackest rapper niggas
Wanna find a new home
Like rasco jeans
My style flip two-tone
Pass my blue chrome
Here's one of the best of busta rhymes own
My debut made you
Wonder who
Shit blazes so much
You wish you could play out
So you could blaze, too
Before I shout you
Or give reason to doubt you
I study shit and re-analyze everything about you
My rhymes on the preserve
Niggas know we deserve 
Everything up in your stash and in the reserve
Fuck that!
Hook up all my lyrics on the echos and the re-verbs
Never fuck with these herbs
My squad remains superb

(heh) walkin' through the streets
Undercovers follow us, stress
Muthafuckas on the regular to bust 
Trust us
We don't get enough
Nigga wha-what?
Dirty baggy jeans
Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match
Quick,
Whip up a batch
Of bullets to blow up the map
Shit
Collapse, perhaps doing this in the raps
In the long time, ya trapped
Buck make em react
God verse attack
Let em know the moon is still black
And it's a fact

Now what be the shit that make them niggas think 
When they ship come in, they ship won't sink

Showin mothafuckers I be down for shit 
Real quick to do my justice 
Walk the streets and stay close to my musket 
Bust this, everytime I hit the corner I notice at night 
Niggas always want to see a fight, crowd around it like 
Cause a scene, some dumb nigga might pop off a shot 
In the air for props, followed by the cops and the ghetto bird 
Swoop down and hit them niggas while they standin on the curb 
What a herb, kick off a shot in the air 
Make the crowd shatter, kid you should've splurged 
Now all I see is a fleet of DT's 
Comin in the direction of be	-D-be	 
Kick up dust, can't get bust, duckin darts 
See they want to shoot the god

Losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high
Losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high
Losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose

But I'm not trying to sing the blues
'cause life goes on, remembering the verse Nitty showed me the song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellowin' Juda blaze the Cocoa

But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick 'em off, soon be back to bill yo

On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows
My peeps keep me grounded, so my head don't blow
It's a struggle but the mo, I smoke the mo my mind flow

Losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high everybody fuckin' wit me
'cause they know I keep a pound of trees 'cause I gotta maintain in me
But I'm losin' my mind, tryin' to stay high
Gotta link with my B.N.C.

It's the life of my man who lived for the root of all evil
I can't knock him though, 'cause we was once consider peoples
We broke bread at the same chicks crib, two ribs
We just roughed up gums, we just brushed up

I burglarize my first joint playin' with stack money
Who motto was ""I die for it"" quote from Stack Money
Head cappo, 'cause shots round the big apple
Ain't never been no punk, my guns bust directly at you

Would of sworn he was the thoroughest, came threw like the prettiest
Big boy Benz, 500-S series
Dump him for the love of money, by the root of O.J.'s
'Bout it to half smoke Philly comin' out the ash tray

I didn't even know, just knew my man, Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin' up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which body cocked thee
Returned to death stair, eye's full of blood shot

Try to block it wit a chuckel, hit that shit nigga, fuck you
Fuck him, pull my coat, just hop up on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin' on the rulers
Don't hit the spliff, less until you twist the Buddhas

I'm losin' my mind, rollin' my dime
Friend of mind, tryin' to lace my weed
That's a muthafuckin' friend I don't need

It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game

I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst shit that's what happen when you thrust

You think you comin' home, but you meetin' chrome
You really thought you had the throne, 'cause you was the bone
On the block, as the bomb rock, now you
Under a rock, so the money stop, gettin'

All the rules of the game, so you plan flop

'cause you know I gotta roll it in the leaf, can't fuck with no stemi

Hustlin' my lyrics like drugs, I find it bug
Muthafuckas always gotta lock the safe but they don't do jay
But anyway, it's another day, another dollar to earn, more weed to burn

I learn, muthafuckas are jealous
Listenin' to what they tell us but don't matter what fellas
I figure this, niggas want Buck to get nigga-rich
Bigger miss, while I'm kickin' this

You miss, I can put you on the list, in the studio to make hits
'cause all it takes is a whip, for you to flip
Jock what I got, clock what I got
But you don't got what I got, watch the block

Listenin' to grill chill, make you feel like you wanna get in my shit
Sip my dick, do it straw what for, while you war wit war
War only make money for niggas who think, dummy
You got your window wide open like it's sunny outside
Sleep, nigga, boom bye bye

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in
The shot ti fly now that sound bwoy lie dead
Two shots dead to dem chin, enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to a muthafuckin' end

Listen to, me and you
Won On Won like Tek-N-Steele, fuck ya whole crew
Forty millimeter shells in the heater well
Look like ya niggas gotta be the first to bail

Just because ya niggas from jail, just came home
To flip, back up in the jail cell, to sit
And roam, now, I got a kite from my little nigga Cappone
Tellin' me the jail wars on

I know, I was listenin' to po-po
Tell 'em niggas it was on a long time ago
Gather up the firearms to bomb, ring the alarm
'cause shit get slippery and sweaty palms

So I gotta remain calm
Gather up my thoughts so I don't go wrong
Plan to move too smooth, you think you got me

Weak tar in copy, fake villain, who the fuck you killin'?
I'm willin' to bet, you think you in it but your street is still a vet
Slapped and tried, boom bye bye

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in
The shot ti fly now that sound bwoy lie dead
Two shots dead to dem chin, enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to a muthafuckin' end

Although when I come, I come abstract
Most people get it whenever they play it back
Black or book you read or a hook you said
BD get stuck up in ya head, say it in the bed

BD, BD, BD, up in ya zone, BD, BD, BD, breakin' ya bones
But no matter what, I never break into ya home
'cause your house is not a home, if you don't got chrome

Now, you follow me and you don't ask how
Well, as a leader, I'ma make you play the background
Mercenary but I'm merciless and when I bust, I bust to hit

Will lie in the mist and you hear it twist, of somebody cap
Steady bustin' in the front and got hit in the back
Thought it couldn't happen, just 'cause you was strappin'

Bullets hit the wind and descend to detonate, target chest plate
Blow up the earthquake, can't wait to demonstrate
The force of the one, two roll wit I
Sleep thought you slept, boom bye bye

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in
The shot ti fly now that sound bwoy lie dead
Two shots dead to dem chin, enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to a muthafuckin' end

Boom bye bye to a sound bwoy in

Brother, you better check the shit I got in store
'cause, what I got in store keeps me ready for the war
W-A-are, are-A-W raw, I saw more than the average citizen
Shit is in style, fuck a ass til it smile

Meditation, constant concentration
When I inhale and exhale for all my niggas whose facin death row
Time to flow on another mission Buck, no diggity
Let's go, my dignity, when police be friskin me
Like you found the burner on the BD MC

When you raise your glock, but me and my niggas on the top

Stupid, now I'mma hit ya mentality from behind
I know you're not alone in your zone
So I'mma enter your fuckin cypher where you roam
And turn your house into my home, just 'cause I'm the ruler
Sun ruler, school a nigga, while you try to fool a original crook
We never stop thinkin, minds constantly on the move to keep it linkin
Like chains, you know we maintain, what?
Boot Camp Clik represent nigga, we don't give a fuck

It's easy, listenin to Buckshot, while I rock knots
Guarantee to put a bullet shot inside ya niggas who
Try to step to, Buck, the BDB, plus I hold my rep too
Fuck, I'm just a nigga you can listen to
Clear, you can understand every word you supposed to
See 'babble' is a word in your vocabulary
Not mind, nigga, when I rhyme, you can hear the sign of the scorpion
Got you coughin in, stuck by the venom that I put in him
Always loose, never win, I'm developin

To let all them niggas know

And if I take 49, and you're left with one
See the one that jammed in ya ear, made ya deaf son
Take ya breath son, nah, here's the oxygen
Fuck it, bring the motherfuckin glocks again
Throw ya hands up, when I spit six to tear ya man up
Now you can't stand up, fucked your whole plan up
Every time the gun jam up, the back slam up
Upside ya head, give me my respects

Yo, there's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
Don't no one survive, the toast on my side, we both gonna die
 
A nigga and his man tried to front, they both in disguise
See before Jesus, the only man chosen was I
And you can a dream or a nightmare, and I'm right there
Standin' over there, wit a bead and a mic there
Puff there, Hype there, Russell there, Mike there
All them niggas watch me embarrass you, right there
From Brook-Nam to Queens, all the way to Yonkers and back
Anywhere you go, you see the knights only attack

I thought I told these motherfuckas they ain't in our class
Quick fast, I strip them from they stripes, snatch they thug patch
Fuck that, I make 'em run and get they wife and come back
You dumb black, bum raps is what y'all got
It'll take a forest fire, just to make ya hot
And I ain't got no time for them weak ass rhymes
And then, when you spittin' it's three and four at a time
Come on now, I hate to be rude and shit
But it's only a chosen few that can do this shit
I thought you knew this shit, and ran through this shit
But you still sample shit, and gettin' sued and shit
You know you makin' me sick, like the flu and shit
And stage ya monkey ass, leave the zoo and shit
You see I rule wit shit, wit any bit I spit
That rap crack, you phat, ain't all that and shit

'Cause you ain't gonna gain no clout, no doubt
I know you want to be wit me, but I
Stay single and remain mingle and
'Cause there's so many out jinglin', oh my God
So I guess time will tell what's out there for Swan
To move it on, is what you always say to me
That's what I always do, but you still pagin' me
What's the deal? You ask keep it real, so it be
But I come to find out that got at least three
More 'fro's that you braidin', on the D-L
So I guess it's time for me to bounce the ball like Sprewell
See well, you could of had it all, Ms. Dove
But you showin' Swan, ain't that much love
Get control of your life, get control of your mind
Get control of your body, girl, take your time

Take your time, take your time
Take your time, take your, take your time
Take your time, take your, take your time
Take your time, take your time

Listen up quick, baby jink
Gotta lotta shit to get wit, stuck in the game and I can't
I'm thinkin' of a master plan
Buck's hot as cool, to see a fan when I'm on the spot
Now some think I'm not, human
Even thought I got the bomb and my shit's boomin
I'm leavin' your room in, no space
If you want to make a mistake, get up in my face
Talkin' about, yo I gotta be off
Pause, just because you want to get up in my drawers
You ready to break laws, visions of your clothes in my back
Just because you stack, now you want to act
Like you know you got your rhyme on cock
And everything I do, shit stop for you, shit
Please, thirty two degrees, of the breeze
About to hit you wit the good law special
Why did you, how could you, get upset
 
When I said my money comes first, I bet
You don't know, that I gotta lotta shit on my mind
So before I fall off, momma said

[Chorus:]

You want to know why I be trippin' when I hear her name
'Cause every rider in the hood, know she all about game
See me on the block, she ask me where I been
She know where I been, probably tryin' to cash in
See me in the Vibe, see me in The Source
Got my act together, she see me on floss
Now you want to fuck me, slow down girl
I used to want to fuck you, but I been around the world
I seen the more, dealt wit a lot
Now what make you think I'm gonna pay for that twat
That's what you here for? You exceedin'
Definitely speedin', slow down girl
Get control of your life, get control of your mind
Get control of your body, girl, take your time

Now you want to stress me out, you put me on a route til my hair fall out
Now what's that all about? I'mma bob and weave
Duck ya bullshit, see Buck ain't up, fuck ya bullshit
Bitch, tellin' me my style was a fluke
'Cause I wouldn't give you boots, and you thought I was cute
I got loot, see money is all that I'm about
Just coolin' wit my niggas and bustin' it out
I'm BDI, you could tell by the vision I use
I see you fake bitches for blocks, I never snooze
See she want to put me on cruise
Set me on a straight path, what about I had to laugh at her
'Cause I ain't gon' fall, runnin' around talkin' about New York
Check this out, now she ready to brawl
I got a call from the C.O.P., tellin' me to stand tall
Caught me in the mall wit all, my homies wit me
Shorty had to be on the scale of one to three
Damn, a dime, but whatever poppa said, BDI, you gotta

Buckshot,"[Buckshot]
It was a puff of black smoke, in the air
I choke, then I witness two beady eyes there
Glare, wit no fear, pitch black
Waitin for the brother to attack, I tried to speak
I tried to talk, but my voice is gone
I feel like I'm on the other side, word is bond
But he ease up and tell me to stand still
I can't move at my own will, chill, I don't feel
That the situation cause for panickin, I'm stiff like a mannequin
But then again, when I felt the cold breeze
Ease across my back, lay back, in the wind, watch a brother cease in
Out the window, smooth like a puff of smoke, when I take a toke
I feel the body ain't no joke
So follow me, as I follow him
Into the night, and you can see the light

[Chorus 4X]
I feel like I'm trapped in the world of rap
I feel like I'm trapped

[Buckshot]
Wake up, you can kill the steady talk
We gon' steady walk, where?
First look in the eye of a needle and stare
Dreads in my hair, oh yeah, the BDI glare, yeah
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, you can come near me, don't fear me
But spare me, the bullshit you talk to everybody else
'cause it's irrelevant to those who got knowledge to self
Why equals self, so why ask why, I try
Not to ask why, while my shotty lie beside my bed
Thoughts in my head make my dreads grow, so you bled slow
But you wouldn't let go, the best is yet to come
Lay back as I kick some lyrics from my dia-
Phragm, God damn, somebody got lost, here I am, whose the boss?
Verbal floss (floss) if you know what's best for you
When they rescue, BD Buck shot at the average group
Ain't nothin personal, but at rehearsal
I'm serve justice for a click, and we roll thick

[Chorus 4X]

[Buckshot]
One man steps up to the mic, right, by a little man, right
Short height, smooth throat, that's made to float
And came to drop the bomb, everybody is listenin, so I remain calm
And drop it on the topic of the dress code
Timberland strapped type, and stomp a nigga head mode
We reside on the bowls of peace in the belly of the beast
But how can't here be peace when the Devil never cease
To cause mischief, this shit is makin me griff
Outta control, I'm fed up wit it, I'm dead up wit it
See I'm ready for head up wit it
Shit it on who? Back in '82, it was you
Yup, you started it, now everybody wants a little part of it
What, the rap music, I know you can't refuse it
But I'm here to tell you that you must lose it
Strictly convo, rhythm and poetry, shit, it got to go

When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes

Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block

My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds

Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps

Never forget the method, stick and move strictly

With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI

Will you see what my man may go that I roll shit then close shit, out

I ain't having it don't try to give me dap
I don't fuck with rats if you take the pack
Better bring that money back
It's a simple fact, that the bill is scrapped
With the milli mac, hit you with a rack
It's a mummy wrap
Haters jumping out got you frozen like a snapshot
Drumroll your whole team the mascot
Pure killa, no filter hoover gang
Real niggas never speak about our murder game

Crippling bullies, black hoodies
Get fully loaded nigga, I smack pussy
Pussy pussy cat, come here pussy cat
Pull that hoodie back
We shooting first ain't no shooting back
I like my bitches from the hood

She told me bring that big dog
I told her bring that cootie cat

Down that shit I be quick to cop the tooly back

Till they get they whole head knocked off
My nigga still shocked from the crack era
20 years later coming home together

This style is that really good shit
This that wish a nigga would shit
2pac and Suge shit
Got a lot of niggas mad because the money's steady coming in
When I pull my phone out them bitches put they number in
Automatic guns you can call my niggas drummer men
And when they go burrrrahh, you see a bunch of running men
If you ain't fucking with M.A aye well fuck 'em then
The mixtape is coming that's a way to bring the summer in

25 years with an L on it
Put a closed eye no scale on it
Fuck paid a quarter hope it come back
If not guns out and we come back
Still from day one all about the money
Paranoid niggas so they move funny
Taught a boy learn from the hand to hand
Death is life, you can die or you stand

I don't give a fuck, not a motherfuck
Not a single solitary fuck
Pussy cream when the pistol buck
Keep a pistol tucked
Come up missing when you mess with us
Fuck the game, bitch I run the team the commissioner
I'mma freak, I'mma vicious one
Got some bitches tougher than you niggas that will hit you up
Tell the coroner, zip you up
Pop a zip, tell a sensai roll a cinci up

Brooklyn, home of the official
Motherfuckers comeing with a shock for your body tissue
Probably miss you if you was somebody important
Irrelevant rappers getting clapped in that black coffin
That's often seen when I'm on the scene nah-mean?
M.A said get him Buck, I get him with the team nah-mean?
When I'm on the scene nah-mean?
M.A said get him Buck, I get him with the team
Get him boy feel what I'm spitting boy
When the clip deploy niggas get destroyed
RIP, now all I need is a clip of blow it in the crowd
Fuck loud that ain't shit to me, I'm a riot

IÂ´m better off without you

And find a way to make it through another day

to find the truth within me
Accept the fact that I love you

I hear they say
What doesnÂ´t kill you makes you stronger
I must have the heart of a lion
Sifting through loveÂ´s remains

Would tarnish any jewel

Turn a diamond to simple coal
Because in all my life
I never met that someone to make me feel love was right, alright

To bring your love
Back into my empty world

I'll try to understand
'Cause the moment you wee in my life
Made me better than I am

Now I see how issues from the past
Can manfest themselves
In your feelings for others
My bitter heart would poison loving souls of those

Who tried to come too close
And then you came into my life
And filled me with the strength
To face the pain inside me

Now that I've given you
The best part of my heart
I see you have your issues too
Your issues too

Black Monday
That's what this joint is all about
Black Monday
A million men strong without a doubt
Black Monday
It's not just a role that one plays
Black Monday
So we can have justice one day
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday

Hey Yo, be, I thougt we conquered the world
When a million men came and shined like a
Black pearl
This time there was no black on black crime
'Cause everybody was thinkin' of ways that pays for
The black mind
One & equal
Not thinkin' of wealth
But knowledge of self
So the past won't repeat like a sequel
Visions of unity
Strong in the community
The same song sung for diplomatic immunity
Is soon to be reality
Not just a formality, an actuality
Built strong by our morality
Can you see what I can see
One force that be lettin' me be what I be
Without costing me members of my family tree
One man can stand for all
But who got his back when he fall
Yo, I had a dream that one day
One million men stood strong and we called it
Black Monday
Black Monday
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday
By now we all know that some wrongs have
Been committed
So be wise, organize my man
Yo, you with it?
Let's have the courage to stand up and speak out
Reach out and help out
No doubt
See we can actually make a difference
The politicians got game, but I say who are
They kiddin'
Seriously, we gotta get our own thing tight
'Cause we ain't even learned
To treat our own peeps right
You don't have to be a scholar to acknowledge
You shouldn't harm your own just 'cause your
Fiendin' for dollars
That's messed up, so fess up
It's good for the soul
Repent
Change your ways
Exhibit more self control
We must be willin' to stop the killin'
'Cause if not
We'll destroy what our forefathers were building
Step up
Do something
It's your duty and purpose
All the material pleasures ultimately are worthless
Curses
They are not needed to explain that
You will wreck your brain
If you do not maintain
Reconciliation, restoration and resolution
Atonement
Completion of perfect union

Of a heart that heals with time...
Still I see in you
Someone I once know
Way back in the past
When my song had words
And the words were meant for you

Tell me when did our future end?
Now I see the truth staring out a window
At love gone astray
Running from herself
Trying to make believe
That it was just a dream
'Cause when love asks of you
More than you can give
You find a way to disappear
Don't you think it's strange
That love could make us strangers?

To be your friend
You ask too much of me
For now I need some time to be
Alone, yes alone
Isn't it strange to love alone
I know 'bout the future
Only time will tell
If you see in me
Someone you once know
A shadow in your life
Before your song had words
And your words will ring true
About love you left in the flames
Well when the smoke clears and I rise
You'll see pain deep in my eyes
But you won't see a tender heart afraid of breaking

The time for tears is yesterday
The time for my life is now
It's time to say
My heart will rise again
I will rise again",Phoenix,1997
Buckshot LeFonque,"'Tis love which makes the elephant forget
'Tis love which makes the elephant forget
Weary with toil, my soul seeks sweet repose
Yet far from home, no comfort is there to find
My mind at journey's end resumes command
To cast unshadowed doubt (one might suppose)
Our zealous pilgrimage fo sorts unkown
Varied states of enduring discontent
Lead my mind and soul to mortal clatter
Lo thus, my heart ascends the royal throne
And like the thief woh borrows not, but takes
The lover who invokes a jealous rage
With vulgar thoughts spoke venomous in tone
Creates a trembling air, which ultimately quakes
Forgive me not for harboring roguish ways
Not for crude language from a brutal tongue

So guilty am I, myself, love shan't acquit",Weary With Toil,1997

Mmm mmm yeah East coast no doubt 
Hip hop is somethin you live rap is somethin you do 

Verse One: 
Sorta distorted yo that's a fact 
Bad news gave a nigga in the mind contact 
I react on blues then use it within 
Blend conscious thoughts to make man mortal men 
see right ways to shell out this thing hip hop 
I pledge O.C. will only season the crops 
And never stop side drops or shot, I'm fiendin 
Covering more ground than news on CNN 
Being in the state of vast consumption in this game 
it's like drugs only quantity is run throughout 
Quality is walking through the valley of the reaper 
True deceivers are coming through your receivers 
Solid foundation to me is the true meaning of hardcore 
We need a little bit more... 

Chorus: 4X (layered on samples) 
Love and affection 
""What I represent is MC's gone mad"" --> Q-Tip 

Verse Two: 
I'm living in the time where life be a buck 
more worth than a child this rap shit suck 
Very few or should I say a handful of MC's 
Talk live, calling themselves kickin life, indeed 
I listen and take a look around only seein who's 
all about frontin and who's profilin 
While my glock I had, guess what I forsaw 
True for now I'm not surprised we didn't rise not at all 
Too many clicks for dolo, weak hitting solos 
My scrolls, they always paint visual photos 
O.C. worth more than a million 
Building nuff respect on the circuit of rap like Sicilians 
You might see the be	-boy when I walk New York 
Crew of brothers recognized so I stopped to talk 
Even the girls be hawkin sassi-fraskin askin 
What's going on and am I still rapping 
Things will change with hope galore 
But when it comes to rap, we need a little bit more... 

Chorus 
Verse Three: 
Big you hold your head and God bless your wife 
Got your little baby girl so I know she's alright 
I strike the mic anytime smashing yours 
Word are wise with wisdom with the width of a wall 
and way describe I prescribe antidotes 
Curing, reassuring my lyrical notes 
Make an impact a fact on the backs of men 
Magnified to the fullest magnificent 
Brilliant, my composition is efficiently prone 
to set fire to a waste and char your ass to the bone 
Figure, I trigger, bigger, bold bad men 
Come against O you'll be walking away a sad man 
Miles of red tape had me stunted for growth 
but when I took off on wax I maxed the globe 
Didn't happen so far, respect be just building 
Watch for the devils in the forms of chameleons 
Kick the raw slow down on the score 
Think before you write or find yourself falling 
Final calling, you're spreading infection 
When it comes to rap, we need a little bit more...

Bucky & John Pizzarelli,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1990
Bucky & John Pizzarelli,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1996
Bucky Baxter,"She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She's a big star
She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star",Big Star,2006
Bucky Baxter,"All he could think about was I'm to young for this 
Got my whole life ahead 
Hell I'm just a kid myself 
How'm I gonna raise one 

All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke 
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast 
Oh well, those plans are long gone 

And he said 
There goes my life 
There goes my future, my everything 
Might as well kiss it all good-bye 
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later 
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator 
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl. 

Momma's waiting to tuck her in 
As she stumbles up those stairs 
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear 
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls 

He smiles 
There goes my life 
There goes my future my everything 
I love you, daddy goodnight 
There goes my life 

She had that Honda loaded down 
With Abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes and his American express 
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go 
She hugged the both and headed off to the west coast

There goes my future, my everything

She’s close to leaving

We’ll I don’t know all that much
But you’re maybe out of touch with what she’s feeling

You’d better give her what she’s needing

Bucky Covington,"Well, I grew up back in the sticks
I was raised on cornbread and scripture
And praise God, for teachin' me wrong from right
I had a wild streak three counties wide
The Devil had me dead in his site
It was the hand of God that kept me out of the hands of the law

Mama brought the Bible, daddy brought the belt
Mama set the table, daddy rung the bell
The preacher did his best to show me the light
But Daddy was the one that kept me walkin' the line
Mama sang the gospel, Daddy drove it home
Mama was an angel, daddy was a brimstone
One foot in Heaven, one foot in Hell
I found religion 'tween the Bible and the belt

I guess it rings true what the 'Good Book' says
What you learn young, you never forget
Daddy's belt left quite an impression on me
I can still hear mama's voice in the choir

She set the whole dang church on fire
and it still burns in the deepest part of me

Our cribs were covered in lead based paint
No child proof lids, no seat belts in cars
Rode bikes with no helmets, and, still, here we are, still, here we are
We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved
Had three TV channels you got up to change
No video games and no satellite
All we had were friends, and they were outside, playin' outside

It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time

The pledge of allegiance, then someone would pray
Not every kid made the team when they tried
We got disappointed and that was all right; we turned out all right

Bucky Covington,"We were born to mothers who smoked and drank
Our cribs were covered in lead based paint
No child proof lids, no seat belts in cars
Rode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we are

We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved
Had three TV channels you got up to change
No video games and no satellite
All we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outside

It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time
It was a different world

School always started the same every day
The pledge of allegiance then someone would pray
Not every kid made the team when they tried
We got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all right

It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time
It was a different world

No bottled water, we drank from a garden hose
And every Sunday, all the stores were closed

It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time

I want what I had when I laid down in the arms of the woman that believed in me
And that man I used to be, I want my life back

I walked through the door and sat down at the bar
Had a shot and a beer lit up a cigar it ran through my head, 
Every word that old man said
I had a woman that loved me with all of her heart
But my pride and my temper made it all fall apart
I was to headstrong to admit when I was wrong
It's been 6 months since she moved out
Guess my pride ain't helping me now

I want my life back, I want that house that I called home, 
I want to hear her voice and see her face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms of the woman that believed in me
And that man I used to be, I want my life back

Grabbed my phone jumped in my car
I dialed her number and when she said hello

Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,
Bucky Pizzarelli,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

vanishing memories of things that were said,
they can't try to hurt me now.

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight

They'll remember they'll surrender

The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

So magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of her name, but I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Bud Powell,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Bud Powell,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1962
Bud Powell Trio,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1962

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

That's the kind of magic

Bud Powell Trio,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy (Londonderry Air) [From The Danny Thomas Show],1958

Maybe it's because nobody loves me

Bud Shank,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Bud Shank,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Bud Shank,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1996
Bud Shank,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Bud Shank,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1998
Bud Shank,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1998

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The love that floats on a summer night

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura, but she's only a dream

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?
