Kelly Llorenna,"I feel the night explode,
When we're together.
Emotion overload,
In the heat of pleasure.
Take me I'm yours,
Into your arms,
Never let me go.
Tonight i really need to know.

Tell it to my heart,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Tell it to my heart,
Tell me I'm the only one,
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart,
I can feel my bodyrock,
Everytime you call my name.

Tell it to my heart,
Tell me I'm the only one,
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart,
I can feel my body rock, 
Everytime you call my name.

Tell it to my heart,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The passions so complete,
Its never ending.
As long as I receive,
The message your sending.
Body to body,
Soul to soul.
Always feel your near,
So say the words i long to hear.

Tell it to my heart,
Tell me I'm the only one,
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart,
I can feel my body rock,
Everytime you call my name.

Tell it to my heart,
Tell me I'm the only one,
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart,
I can feel my body rock,
Everytime you call my name.

Tell it to my heart.
Love, 
Love on the run breaking us down, 
Though we keep holding on,
don't want to loose,
No,
I can't let you go.

Tell it to my heart,
Tell me I'm the only one,
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart,

Kelly Llorenna,"You have a heart of gold
You have a heart of gold
A precious jewel to which I was sold
But I just can't justify your love

It hurts to see you walk away
And I'd like to ask you back to stay
To hold you in my arms just one more time
Just one more time

You have a heart of gold
A precious jewel to which I was sold
But I just can't justify your love
It hurts to see you walk away
And I'd like to ask you back to stay
To hold you in my arms just one more time

For a thousand years, here I could stand
Your precious stone held in my hand
But I just can't justify your love, your love
Justify your love

Oh, yeah, yeah, baby, just one more time
You have a heart of gold
A precious jewel to which I was sold
But I just can't justify your love
It hurts to see you walk away
And I'd like to ask you back to stay
To hold you in my arms just one more time

For a thousand years, here I could stand
Your precious stone held in my hand
But I just can't justify your love, your love
Justify your love

I just can't justify your love
You have a heart of gold",Heart of Gold [Flip & Fill Remix],2005
Kelly Llorenna,"All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

I don't want to waste a waking moment; I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize
My heart was telling me lies, for you they're true

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

So hold on tight, let the flight begin
We're an all time high
",All Time High,2006
Kelly Love Jones,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",In My Way,2008
Kelly Love Jones,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

Kelly Marie,"Oh
What's he doing when he looks in my eyes 

I get the feeling that I know I can't hide.
My heart is pounding and my lips are on fire

My pulse is rising and I feel with desire.
And when he looks at me I know there's gonna be
Some hot love.

Hot love
A lot of hot love

Hot love
A lot of hot love. Oh
Hot love.
Hot love
A lot of hot love

Hot love
A lot of hot love.

I fall into his arms and he holds me tight

He smiles and asks me if I'm feeling alright.
He's got the kind of looks that I can't resist

He's got the kind of lips that I long to kiss

Then when he looks at me I know there's gonna be
Some hot love.

Hot love
A lot of hot love

He's just the one that I wanted

He's got that look in his eye

When he stands next to me I feel that ecstasy
Creeping up on me
I'm on fire.

Is there something going on?
Well
I maybe right but I could be wrong.
It's a mystery - I got circumstantial evidence.
Well
I can't be sure 'cause it all depends on you and me.
(What will be will be.)

Tell me what you're gonna do
You know you hold the vital clue to my destiny.
Well

And I sentence you to life with me for eternity.

it's a love trial.
And I ain't gonna hear your plea 'cause it's a love trial.

I'm gonna lock you up and make you mine forever
'Cause you stole my heart and that's a major felony.

Got to have you
can't you see 
'Cause we've got love in the first degree.
Gonna run you in

Who'll testify that it's only you who can satisfy;
You just can't win (that would be a sin).

There ain't no way you're gonna get loose

You're caught in a track and you can't get back.
So you better be cool and take a rule.

Kelly Marie,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

And I don't care if it sounds trite
I'll say it over and over

It makes me feel alive
You gave me all my fire
By watching you live by what you believed
So many things you taught me
And even when you caught me
I always knew that you, you could still see
The best in me

I was a little shocked that he was right on time.
He was really well mannered as he opened my door,
he seemed like the man I was looking for.
He took me to a fancy restaurant,
and told me to order anything I want.
I went to the bathroom and called a couple of friends,
and said: “Oh my god he's such a gentleman”
He want to have a good time,
ass I was drinking his wine.
And then I started to feel really sleepy,
and he had this creepy look in his eyes.

I woke up in the morning about half past eight,
and I couldn't remember what happened to my date.
My stomach was boozy and it didn't feel right,
I couldn't recall a single thing from last night.
My best friend Suzie called me on the phone,
and said: “Girl you really had it going on”.
If you could imagine the fucking look on my face,
When I finally realized I was a victim of date rape.
I went straight to his work and shoved his face to the wall,
”I hope you had a good time mother fucker, now it's time to say goodbye to your balls”.

Is that all you rapist assholes better run with fear.
I would think twice before your next date,
Cause you'll just end up someone's bitch in cellblock eight.

It's a measure of disorder
A matter of time
We're living in entropy

Well it's random reaction that's divided by rage.
A single-handed effort in the escalade.
The static will clear as the masses evolve.
A loss of information as the message fades away, fades away.

Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore
So far from pure, rotten to the core
Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips
with cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold
to bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice
In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on
Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on
Don't understand they playin wit it
Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it
Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun
I'd release slugs black and bust back
See how these players love that, to the point where
I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it
I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself
And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

I been on this road for a long time now
At time it seems like the road is never gonna end
On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains
Peaks and valleys
Even a lot of potholes on this road
It's never smooth, on the road of life
I don't know where I'm going
I just know where I wanna end up at

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Lord can you help me get there?
Please let me get there

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Kelly Price,"I got a secret 
It's here in my heart
And I can't even tell my friends.
How much I adore you 
I'm fallin' apart 
I got to kept it deep within.
The way that I love you 
I can't even say I promise not to
Tell a soul
It won't last too long, a feeling so strong 
And I can't hide the way.

I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me 
'Cause I want to let the world know 
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killin me
'Cause I want to let the world know its you I'm lovin'.

It's something so special, this thing that we share
So why can't we just let it go 
It's easy to see 
Can they know that we should be as one. 
It's out in the open 
Our cover is blown and I don't care who really knows
I need to be with you 
Can't take it no more, cause baby i need you.

Lovin you feels so right, (lovin you feels so right) 
I don't want to have to live a lie (i don't want to lie)
The way you touch, the way you kiss drives me out of my mind
(I'll never love)
Boy I've never loved this way before baby
So I've given you the keys to my door 
With every touch I want you more 
Don't want to let my feelings show
I can't hide.

I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me 
'Cause I want to let the world know 
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killin me
'Cause I want to let the world know its you I'm lovin'.

I'm not afraid to let my feelings show 
I can't hide them no more (no More) 
'Cause no matter what they say 
It's never gone to change the way that I feel for you 
'Cause boy I love (I love you )

I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me 
'Cause I want to let the world know 
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide the way I'm feeling inside

Kelly Price,"This song is dedicated
To all the brothers out there
Who've ever loved a woman
Whether it was your mother

Whether it was a lover 
Or whether it was your daughter
In every woman lies a soul
And in the soul of every woman

Lies the secrets of love
And sometimes 
You don't do right by her
But the way back to her heart

Lives in that same soul
You just have to find it....

So pure, Mmmm
There through thick and thin
No shame in showing 
She is your best friend

So strong
And though you've let her down
You won't see her frown
But make it right and look inside

You will find 
She was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries
But you never cherished her
And you took for granted love

You sigh 
Remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside
She was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

[Chorus]
In her soul you'll find
The way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind
But she's just a precious little girl
In her soul you'll find
The things that made your life seem so worthwhile
Then you can give it in return

So real, Mmm
The way she'll sacrifice
Only for you 
To have the best in life

Been too long
You need to let her know
You want to make it right
You gotta touch her soul to find

You will find 
She was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries
But you never cherished her
And you took for granted love

You sigh 
Remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside
She was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

[Chorus]

(You can't buy)
Can never buy her love
Can never buy her love
'Cause money just won't fill the void

You made oh no
You want to have her love
You've gotta earn her love
Her soul will lead the way
And show you where to go

[Chorus: x2]",Soul of a Woman,1998

I didn't come here to fuss or fight

Sunlight, my shining star	
All of the world to me
All I could ever need
Lately I can feel you've grown away from me
And inside I pray it's not too late to find a remedy

Don't want to live a lie
I don't want to say goodbye
So how can I start again
And how will my heart mend
Here I am alone with only memories
So I'm searching just to find a way to keep you here with me

So I close my eyes
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream

Dreams that you're holding me
Dreams that won't ever be
Visions of loving you
Wanting to make them true
I find myself believing you'll come back to me
Cause I'm trying not to feel the pain, that loneliness can bring

So I close my eyes
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream

It's so hard to make it through the day without you
So I pray for night to dream you're here with me, with me

So I close my eyes 
And I go back in time

Greener pastures never grew cause everything I needed I already had with you 

Been around and tried to find someone to replace the love that made us one
No one else could ever make me whole, you for me and only me for you
Come to me and we can start things new, heaven knows the way that I miss you
Baby please don't take your love from me, Only you can make my life complete

I've learned a lesson, never to let the one you love slip away
Oh baby, it took this tragedy
For me to see that you are the only one, baby you complete me 

I never knew a love, until you came and showed me what it was
And I'll never let you go, never again
I promise you this time, forever
We'll make it last and things will be better

So he left you Uptown, teary eyed, on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma? You want to use my cell?
You running solo? This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beating on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheating on me
I said miss, let me tell you something
Bout who's making major moves and who's fronting
Huh, who's talking loud but ain't saying nothing
And those who get the one they want but keep fronting
He don't appreciate the well til it run dry
Love is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye}
But smart birds choose to fly
Cause we living in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die
Here's my definition, of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in, for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the asking
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think, you want to ride with L?
Some things are meant to be baby, you never can tell
{I want to ride, with you baby}

Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me,
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Making love til ever after
Baby you and me, yeah, you and me

Now we dipping on the FDR
It's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talking and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You scheming, L want a one-night stand
I'm scheming, she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rolling, hoping there's something more
Dreaming about tomorrow and what life got in store
Living, no drama, we can chill, relax
Sex all night in the morn' count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation, we ain't living like that, ya know?
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the game's extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
Cause I want you to think of me when you need a shoulder to lean on
I'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest
But I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodging bullets
Glock in the stash I don't really want to pull it
On some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acrylics
He said your fam' be riding your nerves
And you hate him for never giving you the life you deserve
Remember, the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whats up?

[Chorus]

I promise you, dreams do come true
There's trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your heart's bleeding, how could the sky seem blue?
But listen up shorty, this is what I want to do
Be there for you, baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharing you
And to my ex-girlfriend, never comparing you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby, I'm taking you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tape's bumping and it's setting the tone
Should I jet to the hotel, is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind?
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought 'em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust their was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
Cause you want to be treated like a queen, not a whore
Close your eyes, don't be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you want to do, however you want to do it
Back to back baby, we can get each other through it

[Chorus: x3]

Know mean? Word up
Yeah, yeah
See'mon, see'mon
See'mon, see'mon
Yeah,
I just want you to think about that, ya know what I'm saying?
Late at night when you laying there
And you feel like the whole world is falling around you
Remember these words that I said
There's somebody out there for you baby
Might be me, you never know,
Word up, stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky, know what I'm saying?
Don't let nobody tell you you can't make it
And don't let nobody around you tell you
That it ain't possible to make your dreams come true
Word up,
Know mean? That's real
Queens represent, rock on

The price we'd have to pay
No, no, no

Play that song that ma used to like
To hear me sing in church all the time

I don't know
About tomorrow
I just live from day to day
And I don't borrow from its sunshine
For its skies may turn to gray
And I don't worry about my future
For I know what Jesus said
And today He walks beside me
For He knows what lies ahead
Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to under-understand

Kelly Price,"Wonderin' where you been, baby, baby?

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Really though how much time you think I got?
The clock is ticking, it's ticking away
You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop
'Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure
Let's stick around till the murder occurs
How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her?

At the moment of time when I heard the news
My vision must have been blurred
'Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools
Shit people were saying was absurd to me
But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree
Of hurtin' me, purposely

We were supposed to be husband and wife
So I dedicated my life to you
Why? So you could keep a chick on the side
'Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die
And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie
I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind

Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine
No matter who the bastard was, I was past his love
But he never ran fast enough
I'm a master at the craft 'cause I roll with some master thugs
Laughin' as I pass you up
Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck
I would've set it up so we all had some fun

You assist to get around, I'll be the aid and assist you to get out
Thank them hoes cause you're shit out of luck
And I don't regret what I spit out and bust
I'm sick and tired of you us, I had enough for this sittin' at home
Cryin' 'n' stuff 'n' being alone
Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be
There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Shit, all I ever did was wait and look out the window
And smoke me some endo
It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo'
Gave myself 100% more time to think, was love designed to stink?
Repeatedly you lied to me, told you to confide in me
Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do 'cause I molded you
To fit properly was inside of me

When you're strokin' them, you're thinkin' of riding me
And most of them hopin' to slide with me 'cause I'm a ferocious hoe
When it comes to freaky shit the dopest, you had to blow this
It's all out of proportion and lost your focus
Wasting my time cause I'm just getting older
You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder
44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes

I'm supposed to trust you
Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you, the moanin' and groanin'
Led me to the pillow where you laid your head
Felt like I'd rather be dead instead
Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway
You said you'd always be true
But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you
That's why you ain't answered when I was pagin' you

I hit the door, you duck and dove, she tried to find her clothes
Y'all was dodging bullets holes together
You gonna stay with that broke hefer
You know who the So So Defest is
I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses to keep 'em interested in
You better recognize the good investment
From the West Side of Chi nigga

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

A midnight clear
Was no Santa Claus
No reindeer.
Only me and you
A love brand new
We fell in love at Christmas
It wasn't Valentine's Day
Or the first day of spring,
Summertime may be fine
But love didn't find me.
Till the snow began to fall
That's when everything changed
Cause that's when I found you.
I remember when holidays were blue
Shopping trips, money spent.
Every year de'ja vu
But now I reminisce on a special gift
In you I found it happened one silent night.
Just one year ago when your love found me
Now my life has changed and it's amazing
Cause I prayed for something special to come
But I never dreamed it would be your love.",In Love at Christmas,2001

For this miracle performed,
That through me would come a baby
Who would one day be my lord.
But right now he's just a baby
And the world is not so sure,
Cause while some bow down to worship
There are some who laugh and scorn.
But there's a will
And there's a purpose
That I know he must fulfill
And the reason why you chose me
Very soon will be revealed.
But for now can I just hold him
And keep him in my arms
And for now can I just hold him
And keep him safe from
Lord, I'll give him back to you
Little ordinary mary
Little baby Jesus boy
He's divine in all your planning
But for me he's pride and joy.
But in him there is a story
That the prophets have foretold,
There is honor, there is glory
There's redemption for us all.
Can't even think about him crucified.
Can't even think that he was born to die.

That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there be no crime
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punchin' the clock
No need for screamin' at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbin' me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is schemin?
And every other corner, you're passin' a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm rememberin' this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was sayin ""Back in the days""
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's sayin'

My angel
My sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend
My good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl

Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, just ain't no song
I'm hearin' niggas makin' up scriptions, and playin' along
Probably sayin' I'm the hypocrit, for judgin' these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everbody, hopin' that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shootin' outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Who changed your life, when you hear it?
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feelin' first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't workin'
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And tryin' and get to heaven
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expectin' our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other muthafuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Tell the penitentiaries, we gonna need more schools

What can I do, to make it better?
Yeah, yeah

I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just screamin' away
And then the unevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it remindes me of the now and the past
I say a little prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark rows that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundin's or breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbarable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I can't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout it in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears
Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)
What can I do?
What can I do?

I say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, before the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of this tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool

Do you hear me?
I'm cryin'

I called my mother on the phone
I said mama you won't believe
What just happened to me

He proposed to me
He proposed with a diamond ring
I couldn't believe it
I looked in his eyes and I said Yes

We will be together
This I know
We will love forever (Baby)
My heart told me so
See if you promise to hold me tight
And never let me go
We'll be husband and wife
For the rest of our lives",He Proposed,2003
Kelly Price,"How does it feel
Now that you know
You could've had me
But you let me go
You're on the outside 
Of your own world
'Cause someone else married
Married your girl.

Destiny said we were to be
But you tested fate so
You could run free.
Now you watch in disbelief
While someone else is living your life with me

Your wife, your kids, your house, your cars
Your white picket fence around your green acred lawn
Was written long before you were born
You gave it away, oh what a mistake!

All along you wasted time
Scared to settle down and make up your mind.
But was it worth it all?

To see him walking everyday in your shoes!",How Does It Feel (Married Your Girl),2003

So she got to steppin' out the door
So many years you beat her down
Now you've got another one
Better straighten up
There's a new girl in town

I live here now
The other woman had to leave
'Cause she was trippin'
Now the right one has your keys
I live here now
And I'll never take from you the things she took
That just won't do

So many years she lived for you
So many tears she cried them too (she wet the pillow)
So many memories that won't erase yes
But she's never comin' back 
Don't you look for her 
'Cause I've taken her place

I can't be that woman who let you break her down
I can't be that woman who let you make her frown

Kelly Price,"I'm reading your ""dear john"";
It says you're moving on
You need your space, you need some time 
And greener grass you seek to find
I saw it from afar 
I knew it in my heart
The happiness had gone away
Pretended we would be ok

For every time you've made me cry
I gotta sit and wonder why 
I love you, I still do
I need you, I always will
I want you to hold me tight
I need you with me tonight
I still do

Why do I hold on?
Why can't I be strong?
I know it's time to walk away
But still inside I hope and pray 
That you'll return to me
My eyes too blind to see
That love should never bring me pain
I know I can't go on this way

I gotta wipe away the tears 
I gotta stand and face my fears 
I gotta love myself enough to make it better

I know she's still inside of me
I'll find a way to breathe again
This won't be how my story ends",I Still Do,2003

If you had came into my life before

If I could hold you in my arms awhile
If I could be with you tonight
I would if I could but I can't so please understand

Baby, baby, baby
I've been wondering
Whatcha doing now
And how your life has been
And now I see you baby
'Cause you're back again
And you wanna know
If we can kick it again?
But so much has changed now
I gotta man and some kids 
I've got responsibilities
So I can't just up and leave
But I wanted you to know that

It's our secret baby
Is what you said to me
But there's too much at stake
My home, my family 
The thought is tempting baby
But I won't be weak
Can't go out like that
Never, no way, no how not me!

Another life, another space
Another time, another place
But not right here and now
I gotta honor my sacred vows
Passions high, desire strong
It's feeling right but this is wrong
And I'm not that kinda girl
I gotta go home to my world",If,2003

Alone 'cause he is fighting with danger and
It's getting close, but he won't listen

Protect him but she is not alone

Gaining because she is hiding a baby
That her boyfriend says he didn't father
He said he was in love but now he can't

And something just didn't sound right
And so I'm calling you back to check on you
How you holding up?

Oh everything is fine

You know I don't believe you

Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?

I'm not saying it, but I know you

How you know me?

Cause you're my brother
And therefore I can tell
When something is troubling you

OK OK, I give you that
Nothing's wrong, I take that back
There is something on my mind
But sis, I don't want to waste your time

But I done told you time and time again
Whatever you're going through
You can come and talk to me
And I will say a prayer with you

But I done prayed and prayed night and day
I still can't seem to find my way

Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you
That you're washed up and you're through
But sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again

Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

Can you tell me what to do?

Well first you gotta believe the truth

Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him

That's okay because he believes in you

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to (woah)
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)

So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?

Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door

When we're keeping it real

Trouble can follow where you lead

Just wait, let me make a phone call

To who?

She can help you tear down your walls

I don't want nobody in my business

She's a friend
And besides you need this

You know how church folk can be

Oh, well, I know you must be very busy
So I'm not going to mess around, nah
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

Mm hmm, similar to what I used to go through

Really?

Yes, and sometimes I still do

Yeah?

See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

Yes but if you stand the truth
It will free you

Oh

Just stand strong

Stand strong

But he'll never leave you

No way

You just gotta hang on

You were bruised for my iniquities

Religion's getting thrown out the door
Cause religion ain't workin' anymore
See I learned another way
It ain't like your granny says

I'm livin' the best life there is
With Jesus Christ I've got relationship
Happiness on earth and then
Eternity spent with him",Heaven's Best,2006
Kelly Price,"I've had disappointments
I've had some strife
I've had great suffering
And so much pain in my life

I've had some situations
I really should've lost my mind
But I know god's a keeper
And that he's always right on time

So when I think of his goodness
And what he's done for me
I can't turn back

I remember being homeless
Being mistreated and abused
I remember being talked about
'Cause there were holes in my shoes

Somebody told me that you loved me
You had a better life for me yeah!
I'm so glad that they told me
I'm so glad that I'm free

So when I think about your goodness
And what you've done for me
I can't turn back

[Chorus]
I'm committed to you Lord
So I won't go back
I won't go, I won't go
I won't go

I don't serve him for money
I don't serve him for things
I do serve him cause I'm thankful
For all the joy that he brings

When I was in trouble
He came and rescued me-yeah!
Lord without you I'm nothing
Lord I owe you everything

So when I think about your goodness
And all you've done for me
I can't turn back

I'm committed to you Lord
So I won't turn back
I won't go, I won't go
I won't go, I won't go

(repeat 3x's)

I can't turn back (repeat)

Through all of my sorrow
Through all of my strain
For every one of my struggles
And every one of my pains
Many days when I was crying
Many days I wore shame
But I thank you for sunshine and I thank you for the rain
That's why

I don't serve him for money
I don't serve him for things
But I serve him cause he's faithful
And he's been so good to me


I get joy when I think about
What he's done for me-yeah!
I'm so glad that he saved me
I'm so glad that I'm free

Kelly Price,"I would cry thought no one loved me
Life was just so unfair
If I died things would be better
Maybe no one would care

All alone this ugly duckling
Hung my head down in shame
Wondered why I was created
Til you called out my name

But Lord you made me
Just how you wanted me to be
Shapen in the image of you

Had to fight always a battle
Going on in my mind
On my own had to survive it
Was this all to my life?

Didn't think in had a purpose
Didn't fit in the crowd
Didn't know you made me special
And that you picked me out

And Lord you made me
Just how you wanted me to be
Shapen in the image of you

I'm so thankful

Shaped my destiny, had a plan for me
Then you sent me to the world to proclaim
Your love and grace, so in spite of what men say

This is who I am, this is what I do
I'll spread the gospel, share the good news
This is who I am, this is what I do

Kelly Price,"I had a problem
And I went the wrong way
I came to the altar
And I asked you to pray
Instead you talked about me
Said I wouldn't be blessed
I couldn't believe it, mmm
Thought in church I'd find rest

So heed my warning
Cause the bible it surely says
You can't judge me
For God's judgment will come your way
You may not believe in me
But my God has the final say

See God will take care of me
But He's going to take care of you
Be careful of what you say and what you do

My marriage was messed up
I was broken inside
I had to keep smiling
Cause you were watching my eyes
I talked to the Lord
Said I love you but I'm through
But he wouldn't let me go, no,no,no
Said I got work to do
Please heed

Love and kindness
You were drawn in
Listen
You called on the name of the Lord
And He pardoned you sins
So I beg you, remember
And don't you forget
That weren't for the grace of God
You'd still be a mess

Kelly Price,"Time and time again, 
Back and forth and then
Hating and loving
Breaking and making up

Should we start again
Should we let it end
Staying and leaving, baby

Baby I can't take it, 
We're in and we're out of love
But I can't shake it

Our souls are so twisted up
I'm so frustrated,

Why do we play these games,
Why do we fuss and fight
Why can't we get it right (oh)

You know I'm crazy over you

Yeah, yeah

Down south, I know you're bouncin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right

Kelly Rowland,"Clover walked in
In his baggy jeans and his Prada shoes
He had a nice shirt, nice scent, nice ice
But he's not the one-the one I'd choose
He was the type I never had
Country and thug with lots of class
Something inside me made me hesitate 
So I made him wait

Didn't think he was the one to treat me right
Until he found the love I tried to hide
He said

[Chorus]
Love lives in strange places
It's the obvious that never shows
It just might find you when you least expect it
You'll never know, you'll never know
Until you just let go

Now my baby sister's got a two way
And a cell phone
She's always happy when she gets a page
But it's not love, girl, that's not a home
Real love isn't digital, isn't physical
It's the one that can reach inside
And you don't know why, but it makes you whole

So if you want the one that reaches deep 
Let him see the you that's underneath

[Chorus]

It's in the corners of the sky 
In the shadows of your mind
The unexpected suddenly
Like the child of destiny
No,you can't control the way
So just have faith

[Chorus]",(Love Lives In) Strange Places,2002
Kelly Rowland,"You speak only what you hear
Easily influential
So secluded no one's near
This home's full of rituals
Your mother's goin on strike
Tired of preaching sermons and
Father's vacation tonight
Is somewhat permanent

[Chorus]
I gotta go
To somewhere beyond imaginations flow
Hear my tone
It says I am alone

Your life seems dysfunctional
It only acts what you show
You're your own psychiatrist
A slight minute from quitting
Showing signs of depression
Life's falling over and crashing
Your heart burns through life lava
And rapes your problem solver, now go

[Chorus]

A hideout
Manifest stability
Let go of doubt
Getaway
No flaws will inject or exit my present place
I gotta burn
Experience only allows what I will learn

Imagining your kisses when I close my eyes,
But they don't replace you holding me??

If you're so far away I want you near might sound cliche'
But my words are so sincere can't you
Taste the joy inside my tears (I'm so in love)

I've found love's treasure in this ocean of pleasure
And now that I have, have you, I won't search for anything more

Ooh love, what have you done to me
This crazy feeling I can't describe it feels like love,
It must be love, it must be love

All I can do is run with open arms
And love with all I got, I feel so at home when we're alone oh...

Is begging & it starts
To collect all the elements of love

Tells me it's not healthy still I know
Maybe I'll be the one to teach a lesson baby

I was poppin' sweet

Saw two roses bloom just like me and you

Both late for an appointment, they end up together in a city cab
They share a fare and some friendly conversation
That's no coincidence, that's love

She scrambles through her purse, he rushed in through the front
Lookin' for change, there's a jukebox in the back of the restaurant
They start to dance 'til this day they're still dancing
That's no coincidence that's love

It's amazing, it's perfection
How each little bitty star makes up one big constellation of people
Getting connected, it's truly Heaven sent, it's evident
That love is no coincidence

He snapped a photograph, she took a sonogram
She didn't tell him he shipped off to war in a foreign land
Left home a soldier but came back a father
That's no coincidence that's love

Somebody crashed her car, he's got a failing heart
One thing can save them an operation, neither can afford
But through visitation, two families get acquainted
That's no coincidence that's love

How we intertwine is divine

Open your eyes and you'll find
(It's involuntary)
Seasons have reasons for changing

Can find love, lose love, find love again

Are you gonna apologize?
About the same thing
And how many times
Can I take you back?
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong

When I would pray, the answer would always come
Back to me, being done

When we're in love

So I

That I would make some changes
But the more I change
There's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me

And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I've gotta move on now
Its not the fact
That I don't love you no more
But I've got to break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
I'm learning new ways to live
While you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin' (gotta think about me)
To call me when I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinkin' its gonna solve every issue

From the girl callin' my phone
To the pictures that I saw
And every time you would break up with me
For nothing at all
I've taken all I can take

Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Ladies, drama, leave it home
If he ain't got it right by now, then scratch him off
They just called me, said it's about twenty strong
They standin' at the door, don't wanna take us on
The ring - let it go 'bout three months ago
The pain ain't stressin' me no more
The girl that they used to know done changed
Now they sayin' this before they mention my name

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Like six, six-four, came up real slow, put a good game on me
Told him: 'Partner, don't get too close so comfortable
Cause the quick ain't for me
Got my girls all here, no enemies, always family please
All of your personal info
I ain't thinkin' 'bout love, I just tryin' to get it up
Pop a bottle, talk a lot of bullshit
And let's, let's go

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Tonight I ain't feelin' no (stress)
To my girls that's lookin' their best
Won't you go and show it off for us?
(Ladies, go on, throw your hands up)
And if he's all in your head
Just forget all the things that he said
Girl, this is yours; do whatever you want to
(Ladies, go on, throw your hands up)

Hear these words out my mouth, now, tell you how it's goin' down
Kelly, E-V-E - we comin' through and got 'em bowin' down
Ladies, can you feel it? It's an anthem you can bounce around
Give you just a sec to take your breath; bring it back now
Dudes get excited, seein' what they like, and
Hopin' you the one you choose, hope they get invited
Late night rendezvous is all right
But we lovin' how the club vibratin'; it's enticing
Let the beat knock; trust me, we ain't gon' stop
Here till the light's up; watch us take over the spot
Few mad looks from them chicks you know
And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough
Pop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'
No time for the drama, watch me blow through them
I know I sound confident; I'm supposed to though
We do it big, how we live; Kelly told you so, come on

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this

I got that run back, run back and tell your mother

Warning, beware, handle with care
If you're lucky, there's a chance you'll make it there

I never thought that we would break up for the better

Every moment that I stayed, I dug a deeper hole 
I was with you, but my heart wouldn't let him go

Kelly Rowland,"Can you describe the moment
When two people fall in love?
Some say the clouds will spin in circles
And the rain will turn to doves
The poor will start to laugh
Even the rich will start to cry
It can sneak up like a soldier
It can wake you up at night

That's what I feel when I'm
Standing here with you
That's what my heart has
Sworn to be true

[Chorus]
This is love
It's written on my face
It's the way I lean my body towards you
Even when I'm a hundred miles away
This is love
Like a diamond in the sand
It took so long to find you
I can't wait another day to say... this is love, oh

This is love, yeah

You take my imperfections
And turn them into art
If I could change one thing about you
There would be no place to start
You are safety without numbers
You are dangerously wild
But you're sweeter than rock candy
And you ease my inner child

That's what I feel when I'm
Standing here with you
That's what my heart has
Sworn to be true

[Chorus]

Yeah

No, I'm no easy angel
I'm moody like the wind
I am impatient, complicated
I am fragile deep within
But you're no fool
And I'm no little girl
Have we not found
There is love in the world?

This is love
I said, it's written on my face
It's the way I lean my body towards you
Even when I'm a hundred miles away

Never let me go when love goes faster

But love defies all logic in a picture
Above all that is physical, I'm falling
Falling uncontrollably it terrifies me
So if my compass, it fails me
And I feel I'm walking blind
Don't say goodbye
Don't let me hide
Oh please don't let me spiral
Tortured by you, oh, sweet torture!

See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

If he ain't got it right by now, then scratch him off
They just called me, said it's about twenty strong
They standin' at the door, don't wanna take us on
The ring - let it go 'bout three months ago
The pain ain't stressin' me no more
The girl that they used to know done changed
Now they sayin' this before they mention my name

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this

Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this

Got my girls all here, no enemies, always family please
All of your personal info
I ain't thinkin' 'bout love, I just tryin' to get it up
Pop a bottle, talk a lot of bullshit
And let's, let's go

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Tonight I ain't feelin' no (stress)
To my girls that's lookin' their best
Won't you go and show it off for us?
(Ladies, go on, throw your hands up)
And if he's all in your head
Just forget all the things that he said
Girl, this is yours; do whatever you want to
(Ladies, go on, throw your hands up)

Hear these words out my mouth, now, tell you how it's goin' down
Kelly, E-V-E - we comin' through and got 'em bowin' down
Ladies, can you feel it? It's an anthem you can bounce around
Give you just a sec to take your breath; bring it back now
Dudes get excited, seein' what they like, and
Hopin' you the one you choose, hope they get invited
Late night rendezvous is all right
But we lovin' how the club vibratin'; it's enticing
Let the beat knock; trust me, we ain't gon' stop
Here till the light's up; watch us take over the spot
Few mad looks from them chicks you know
And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough
Pop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'
No time for the drama, watch me blow through them
I know I sound confident; I'm supposed to though
We do it big, how we live; Kelly told you so, come on

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this

Ah look where we are, we've done what they thought we couldn't
As bad as the odds were looking, push yeah, we kept on pushing
And every time I nearly hit the ground, you were my cushion

There's evidence that proves, that you were heaven sent
'Cause when I needed rescuin', you were there at my defense
Girl in you I find a friend, you make me feel alive again
And I feel like the brightest star, 'cause you made me shine again

We're invincible, invincible
Invincible, love's our protector
We're invincible, invincible

We're invincible

Ah from the wildest water, ah to the highest mountains
Ah she went on forever, even through the driest deserts
You lift me higher than ever, I feel as light as a feather
And when we're fightin' together, we can take on the weather

I will keep you warproof, every single storm you
Ever have to walk through, I will go before you
I will be the voice when you need someone to talk to
Please don't ever doubt me, let me reassure you

When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

I sacrificed my life to give you my life to speakers
I tried to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart but my blood's been with demons
I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorant
Far from greedy if you knew what I come from
Knew what I've been through, you think there shoulda
Been another outcome just like most kids
A father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they X you like Malcom
Then you wonder how come I can move in the room
Full of woos, so sweet, so smooth
Thank you mom for making me a man
Let 'em mother fucker knock down my castle in the sand

So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach from my hand

Reach for my hand

I live my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking in front of ? , but they won't find it
I come from struggle, I am a fighter, must you be reminded
My mother's past has a trap, has a blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game,
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future, mom, I love you, I salute you
Then no matter what happens jusst you're the reason I am rappin'


Look I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple
Came down to south beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
Kid hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
This is for my brother took three and went to jail
I'm sending all my pictures through the mail
He hit me with a letter, I know you'll never fail
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",Love the Way You Lie,2011

Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before

They standin' at the door, don't wanna take us on

Hopin' you the one you choose, hope they get invited
Late night rendezvous is all right
But we lovin' how the club vibratin'; it's enticing
Let the beat knock; trust me, we ain't gon' stop
Here till the light's up; watch us take over the spot
Few mad looks from them chicks you know
And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough
Pop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'
No time for the drama, watch me blow through them

I didn't say we wouldn't hurt anyone
That's how you learn, you just get burned
But, we don't have to feel like dirt anymore
Though love's not earned baby, it's our turn

We were always looking for true north
With our heads in the clouds, just a little off course
I left the motor running
Now, if you're feeling down and out

Come on baby, drive south
With the one you love
Come on baby, drive south
With the one you love

I'm not talkin' 'bout retreatin', not this girl
Gonna take our stand, in this Chevy van
Windows open on the rest of the world
Holdin' hands on the way to Dixieland

We've been tryin' to turn our lives around
Since we were little kids
It's been wearin' us down
Don't turn away now, darlin'
Let's fire it up and wind it out

I heard your mama callin', I think she was stallin'
Don't know who she was talkin' to baby, me and you

We could go down with a smile on
I ain't gonna pack my nylons,
Got to leave our legs showin'
It gets hot where we're goin'

With our heads in the clouds, just a little off course

If I won a dollar, I'd make it rain
If it rained an ocean, I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied

It's legs to walk and thoghts to fly 
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die

So tell me baby, I said so loing
Tell my mother, I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own 
And tell my friend to mourn me none

It's not what I had in mind
Loving you now that you're no longer mine
It's not what I had in mind
Letting you go and then crossing that line

I've fallen under some spell and I wonder
What is the right thing to do
I've been here before and I've never been sure
I'm still in love with you

Chorus

Time has weakened my will
And changed how I feel
I want you still

I'm falling over myself to get closer
To you and I shouldn't want to
I can't deny how
You make me feel right now
I'm still in love with you

And now my life can follow through. 
Suddenly, it's all so clear.

And the world would stop for me
And show me love like it should be.

catching my breath each time
Looking up at the stars,
Now they don't seem so far.

You might be successful in real estate

To pass through a needle's eye

You might have a body of fine proportion and a hungry mind
A handsome face and a flashing wit
Lips that kiss and eyes that shine

There might be a lot all around the block
Long before your starting time

Say ""I'm easy come,easy go and easy to love when I stay""

Con un combo de locos que no están jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso

Como me busco la grasa, las cubetas de hielo que tengo en casa
Están al tope, por que lo que consumen no lo rechazan
Desenmoño el topo e' menta, en billetes de 50
Y tu comprando 31 que no cocina en la lenta
Yo sé que les da depre saber to' lo que facturo
Porque viven del menudo, es que mi pauta esta en Neptuno
Te caes si tu me miras, o molestar en la calma china
O tener mira bajaron las F negras en campanilla
Compramos los mil kit de 100 que son pa' las glopetas
Si aprietan van a correr tu y tu mujer en chancletas
A la milla, aquí van de raja pa' la silla
Tengo el money, como dicen los Domi eso a ti te quilla'
Frabian, aquí se descarta a to' el que copera
Yo les paro el explorer siempre antes de 3 letras
Las veinte y cremas, andamos disfrazados de onilafea
Un arresto, te secuestro, y vas de rabo a la candela

Papi yo me busco el peso, pregúntale a Homie
Tengo money, en par de países loco un par de Cholis
Ahora tengo par de pesos, en efectivo
Me mantienen vivos los billetes se llevan conmigo
Benjamin es mi mejor amigo, Jackson es mi primo
Washington mi compadre y fue a la escuela con Lincoln
Revolucionario como tu Duatlon Santo Domingo
I'm a king, en puertorro Luis Muñoz Marin
Yo siempre he sido un soñador, quise ser compositor
Luego me convertí en cantautor
Quería ser un liricista
Puñeta artista  y me convertí en inversionista
Al envidioso digo Tranquilo Bobi
Matarte es mi hobby, en el closh como Kobe
Pa las mujeres soy seguro un orgasmo
Duro y dulce, me llaman el durazno

Hacen reuniones pa' setiarme, dicen que quieren cazarme
Mamenmen el bicho, de ninguno voa dejarme
Aborrecido, harto e' odio damos fuego con los palos también
Que paso? No te gusto? Yo no soy un billete de 100
To' van pal casco, pa' que les de agua los fiscales
Te vamos a procesar con los metales (rascabolas)
Y a los titeres de embuste dile que hagan los ajustes
Que andamos borrando hocicos con un par de fulles
Hoy hay trabajo, hay otro carro que vamos a desmantelar
El que pillemos en la avenida en su madre se va a cagar
Esto no es relajo, lambebicho, demuestre su hombría
A sangre fria si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de dia
Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores
No riego veneno, pero papi sin cojones pai a mi me tienen
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene
Con musica hija e' puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabron

Ya estoy manso muchachos o quieres ver como me agacho?
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho
Ustedes son queso con nachos partirme, tu estas borracho?
Acho en cualquier sentido te desparracho
Las pacas y los billetes las he visto encurrucha'
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos
Se te adelanto lo siento lechon llego Navidad
Jingle bells, el panzon como Santa Claus
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta' en el calzon
Bebo date un resbalon, que me has dado la impresión
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón brra

Ya Los Menores salen pa la calle
Los mas que suenan en la calle bebo se han quedao
Las cosas ya no son iguales
Y del caserio no salen

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco
Mientras yo ando por ahí, willeando en la moto sin casco
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras
Lo que vale el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track
Soy el terror de muchos, el chamaquito incorregible
El que a los 22 tiene 3 casas y convertibles

El que entierra a los demonios y a los muertos los revive

Or through a crakc!

The legend,
The mystery!
It's the Princess Anastasia who will help us fly
You and I friend
Will go down
In history!
We'll find a girl to play the part and teach her what to say
Dress her up and take her to Paree!
Imagine the reward her dear old Grandmama will pay
Who else could pull it off but you and me?
We'll be rich

We'll be rich
We'll be out
We'll be out

And St. Petersburg will have some more to talk about

Kelsey Jessup,"Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

[Chorus]

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down.",Gravity,2009
Kelsey Lockhart,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Spent everything I had

I'm used to being put down

My only hope is anchored
In this fall

If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'd be made whole
If I could just press my way through this madness
His love would heal my soul
If only one touch

So many people calling 
How could He ever know
That just a brush of Him 
Would stop the flow
If He knew would He rebuke me
Or shame me to the crowd
Well I'm desperate 'cause it's never or it's now

If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'd be made whole
If I could just press my way through this madness
His love would heal my soul.

And then suddenly He turned around
He said somebody has unleashed my power
Well, frightened and embarrassed I bowed
You see I told Him of my troubles 
And how

I had to touch the Hem of His garment
And I know I've been made whole
And how I had pressed my way through this madness
And His love has healed my soul.

Then with one word He touched the hem of my garment
And you know I've been made whole
And somehow He pressed His way through my madness
And His love has healed my soul.


I tell you He Touched me.

When no one else would touch me

Kelsey Wood,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak

Que fué, que pasó, por qué esta situación
Hay acaso un intruso entre los dos
Es que acaso no crees en mi amor
A donde tu vayas sabes que iré yo

why mientras tanto ella seguía callada
Ocultándome quien sabe qué
Hasta que con palabras tosadas dijo

Pasarán solamente ocho meses
Why un tercero entre nosotros abrá
Así que piensa si deveras lo quieres

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,2007

Ken Arlen Orchestra,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2001

Ken Coomer,"I was dreaming of the past,
And my heart was beating fast.
I began to lose control, 
I began to lose control.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.

I was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside, 
I was shivering inside.
I didn't mean...

I was trying to catch your eyes, 
though that you was trying to hide.
I was swallowing my pain, 
I was swallowing my pain.
I didn't mean...",Jealous Guy,2002
Ken Curtis,"If I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

And if you took the petals
And you tore them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
The way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
Well, I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you

If you took the petals
And you tore them all apart
You'd be tearing at the roses
The way you tore my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send some roses too
I don't want a room full of roses
I just want my arms full of you",Room Full of Roses,2002
Ken Darby,"From being merely a necessary luxury
And someone sympathetic to have about

Ken Darby,"I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
I want to be with all the kanes and wahines that I knew long ago
I can hear old guitars a playing, on the beach at Hoonaunau
I can hear the Hawaiians saying ""Komomai no kaua ika hale welakahao""
It won't be long 'til my ship will be sailing back to Kona
A grand old place that's always fair to see
I'm just a little Hawaiian and a homeside Island boy
I want to go back to my fish and poi
I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
Where the Humuhumu, Nukunuku a puaa goes swimming by

Ken Darby,"Sunset glow fades in the west, 
Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

But now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.",Now Is the Hour,2006
