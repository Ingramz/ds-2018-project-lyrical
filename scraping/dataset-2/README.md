# Dataset 2

This scraper is based on https://github.com/SoumitraAgarwal/Webscraping-Text-Data/tree/master/Song%20Lyrics

In addition to scraping lyrics, the year of the song, when available, is also recorded.

The re-implementation makes heavy use of task pooling in order to execute many requests at once.

Requires Python 2 to run.

```
python Scraper.py
python Song.py
python Lyrics.py
```
