Data augmentation (2+1h) **I 2**, **M 1**
* Attempt scraping more recent data
* Attempt scraping currently missing data (like year of release) for existing datasets

Data cleanup / transformation of different datasets into one master dataset (2+1h) **I 1**, **M 2**
* Removal of unnecessary fields
* Finding and removal of duplicates
* Verification that all datasets include lyrics that have been cleaned of punctuation and certain stop words

Research (~2h, each) **I 2**, **M 2**
* Re-read and create a list of some existing papers that touch on the subject of lyrics analysis

Creating a ranking algorithm (8+ hours each, tasks can be divided) **I 8**, **M 8**
* Pitching different ideas to solve the problem
* Experiment 1: Classifier + n-grams
* Experiment 2, 3...: To be determined from research
* Comparing the results of different methods
* Assessing feasibility of combining several experiments
* Finalizing the algorithm

Creating a classifier to determine the age of a song based on lyrics (4+ hours, likely 1 person job) **M 4**
* Development
* Analysis/report

Tool to create playlists that can be played on a music streaming service (~3 hours, 1 person) **I 3**
* Familiarization with API
* Matching data to create appropriate list of songs
* Scripting a solution that would create a static playlist from songs within dataset
* Integrating it as one of the possible outputs for the ranking algorithm above

Assessment (~2h, each) **I 2**, **M 2**
* Evaluate the success of models created
* Aggregate results from both team members

Poster/report (~6h, each) **I 6**, **M 6**
* Figuring out the findings what we want to display
* Producing necessary statistics, graphics
* How to present the "ultimate playlist", should we find a small speaker to augment the experience?
* How to gauge interest by people attending the poster session.

Total estimated time for each member is currently 24h.
