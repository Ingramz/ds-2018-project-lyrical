Data augmentation (~2-3h, 1 person or divided between two)
*   Attempt scraping more recent data
*   Attempt scraping currently missing data (like year of release) for existing datasets

Data cleanup / transformation of different datasets into one master dataset (~3h, 1 person)
*   Removal of unnecessary fields
*   Finding and removal of duplicates
*   Verification that all datasets include lyrics that have been cleaned of punctuation and certain stop words

Research (~1-2h, each)
*   Re-read and create a list of existing papers that touch on the subject of lyrics analysis

Creating a ranking algorithm (8+ hours, can be divided)
*   Experiment 1: Classifier + n-grams
*   ???

Creating a classifier to determine the age of a song (4+ hours, likely 1 person job)
*   Using entire dataset available
*   Cross-validation
*   Analysis - does it really work?

Tool to create playlists that can be played on a music streaming service (~3 hours, 1 person)
*   Familiarization with API
*   Matching data to create appropriate list of songs
*   Scripting a solution that would create a static playlist from songs within dataset
*   Integrating it as one of the possible outputs for the ranking algorithm above

Assessment (~2h, each)
*   Evaluate the success of models created
*   Aggregate results from both team members

Poster/report (~5-8h, each)
*   Figuring out the findings what we want to display
*   Producing necessary statistics, graphics
*   How to present the "ultimate playlist", should we find a small speaker to augment the experience?
*   How to gauge interest by people attending the poster session.
