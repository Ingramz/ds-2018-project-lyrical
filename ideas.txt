Prep:
    1.See of it's possible to get # of hits in the site through web crawling.
    2.Idem with genre, year in the datasets where it's missing.
    3.Decide if we're dropping any datasets
    4.Once we have all relevant fields, remove duplicates


Analysis ideas:
Create alternative top 100s:
    as described in the goals

Measure of similarity between lyrics:
    1. find or invent a feature (or set of features) that measures similarity between 2 pieces of text.
    2. Sample genres/years/whatever and build a "correlation matrix" between songs
    3. hierarchically cluster together, see which are most similar, which are most different, etc.

Extract themes from lyrics:
    1. find most common words in lyrics, and words that often appear together with them (within x words, before and after) (follow log-likelihood)
    2. Get clusters

Train our own lyrics-predictor based on our datasets and see what it comes up with.
    Markov chains or something?

Make word-clouds
    it's always pretty interesting
